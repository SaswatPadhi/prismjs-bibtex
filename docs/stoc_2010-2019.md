  abstract =     "The 17th of the problems proposed by Steve Smale for
                 the 21st century asks for the existence of a
                 deterministic algorithm computing an approximate
                 solution of a system of $n$ complex polynomials in $n$
                 unknowns in time polynomial, on the average, in the
                 size $N$ of the input system. A partial solution to
                 this problem was given by Carlos Beltran and Luis
                 Miguel Pardo who exhibited a randomized algorithm, call
                 it LV, doing so. In this paper we further extend this
                 result in several directions. Firstly, we perform a
                 smoothed analysis (in the sense of Spielman and Teng)
                 of algorithm LV and prove that its smoothed complexity
                 is polynomial in the input size and $\sigma - 1$, where
                 $\sigma$ controls the size of the random perturbation
                 of the input systems. Secondly, we perform a
                 condition-based analysis of LV. That is, we give a
                 bound, for each system $f$, of the expected running
                 time of LV with input $f$. In addition to its
                 dependence on $N$ this bound also depends on the
                 condition of $f$. Thirdly, and to conclude, we return

                 assignment of capacities to the edges of $G$ and

                 condition if for any cut in the graph, the total demand
                 crossing the cut is no more than the total capacity
                 crossing it. The pair $(G, H)$ is called cut-sufficient
                 if for any assignment of capacities and demands that
                 satisfy the cut condition, there is a multiflow routing
                 the demands defined on $H$ within the network with

                 becomes the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,p}$, with $p

                 the $p$ vertices of degree $2$, and an edge connecting

                 and capacities incident to each vertex is even --- then
                 the multiflow problem has an integral solution. We
                 provide a polynomial-time algorithm to find an integral
                 solution in this case. In order to prove these results,
                 we formulate properties of tight cuts (cuts for which
                 the cut condition inequality is tight) in

  abstract =     "Forty years ago, Wiesner pointed out that quantum
                 mechanics raises the striking possibility of money that
                 cannot be counterfeited according to the laws of
                 physics. We propose the first quantum money scheme that
                 is (1) public-key --- meaning that anyone can verify a
                 banknote as genuine, not only the bank that printed it,
                 and (2) cryptographically secure, under a ``classical''
                 hardness assumption that has nothing to do with quantum
                 money. Our scheme is based on hidden subspaces, encoded
                 as the zero-sets of random multivariate polynomials. A
                 main technical advance is to show that the
                 ``black-box'' version of our scheme, where the
                 polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is
                 unconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had
                 only been known relative to a quantum oracle (and even
                 there, the proof was never published). Even in
                 Wiesner's original setting --- quantum money that can
                 only be verified by the bank --- we are able to use our
                 techniques to patch a major security hole in Wiesner's
                 scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money
                 scheme that allows unlimited verifications and that
                 remains unconditionally secure, even if the
                 counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank.
                 Our money scheme is simpler than previous public-key
                 quantum money schemes, including a knot-based scheme of
                 Farhi et al. The verifier needs to perform only two
                 tests, one in the standard basis and one in the
                 Hadamard basis --- matching the original intuition for
                 quantum money, based on the existence of complementary
                 observables. Our security proofs use a new variant of
                 Ambainis's quantum adversary method, and several other
                 tools that might be of independent interest.",

                 lower bounds on the update time and query time of
                 dynamic data structures in the cell probe model. With
                 this technique, we prove the highest lower bound to
                 date for any explicit problem, namely a lower bound of
                 $t_q = \Omega((\lg n / \lg (wt_u))^2)$. Here $n$ is the
                 number of update operations, $w$ the cell size, $t_q$
                 the query time and t$_u$ the update time. In the most
                 natural setting of cell size $w = \Theta(\lg n)$, this
                 gives a lower bound of $t_q = \Omega((\lg n / \lg \lg
                 n)^2)$ for any polylogarithmic update time. This bound
                 is almost a quadratic improvement over the highest
                 previous lower bound of $\Omega(\lg n)$, due to
                 Patrascu and Demaine [SICOMP'06]. We prove our lower
                 bound for the fundamental problem of weighted
                 orthogonal range counting. In this problem, we are to
                 support insertions of two-dimensional points, each
                 assigned a $\Theta(\lg n)$-bit integer weight. A query
                 to this problem is specified by a point $q = (x, y)$,
                 and the goal is to report the sum of the weights
                 assigned to the points dominated by $q$, where a point
                 $(x',y')$ is dominated by $q$ if $x' \leq x$ and $y'
                 \leq y$. In addition to being the highest cell probe
                 lower bound to date, our lower bound is also tight for
                 data structures with update time $t_u = \Omega(\lg^{2 +

  abstract =     "A central issue in applying auction theory in practice
                 is the problem of dealing with budget-constrained
                 agents. A desirable goal in practice is to design
                 incentive compatible, individually rational, and Pareto
                 optimal auctions while respecting the budget
                 constraints. Achieving this goal is particularly
                 challenging in the presence of nontrivial combinatorial
                 constraints over the set of feasible allocations.
                 Toward this goal and motivated by AdWords auctions, we
                 present an auction for polymatroidal environments
                 satisfying the above properties. Our auction employs a
                 novel clinching technique with a clean geometric
                 description and only needs an oracle access to the
                 submodular function defining the polymatroid. As a
                 result, this auction not only simplifies and
                 generalizes all previous results, it applies to several
                 new applications including AdWords Auctions, bandwidth
                 markets, and video on demand. In particular, our
                 characterization of the AdWords auction as
                 polymatroidal constraints might be of independent
                 interest. This allows us to design the first mechanism
                 for Ad Auctions taking into account simultaneously
                 budgets, multiple keywords and multiple slots. We show
                 that it is impossible to extend this result to generic
                 polyhedral constraints. This also implies an
                 impossibility result for multi-unit auctions with
                 decreasing marginal utilities in the presence of budget
                 constraints.",

  abstract =     "Consider a gambler who observes a sequence of
                 independent, non-negative random numbers and is allowed
                 to stop the sequence at any time, claiming a reward
                 equal to the most recent observation. The famous
                 prophet inequality of Krengel, Sucheston, and Garling
                 asserts that a gambler who knows the distribution of
                 each random variable can achieve at least half as much
                 reward, in expectation, as a ``prophet'' who knows the
                 sampled values of each random variable and can choose
                 the largest one. We generalize this result to the
                 setting in which the gambler and the prophet are
                 allowed to make more than one selection, subject to a
                 matroid constraint. We show that the gambler can still
                 achieve at least half as much reward as the prophet;
                 this result is the best possible, since it is known
                 that the ratio cannot be improved even in the original
                 prophet inequality, which corresponds to the special
                 case of rank-one matroids. Generalizing the result
                 still further, we show that under an intersection of
                 $p$ matroid constraints, the prophet's reward exceeds
                 the gambler's by a factor of at most $O(p)$, and this
                 factor is also tight. Beyond their interest as theorems
                 about pure online algorithms or optimal stopping rules,
                 these results also have applications to mechanism
                 design. Our results imply improved bounds on the
                 ability of sequential posted-price mechanisms to
                 approximate optimal mechanisms in both single-parameter
                 and multi-parameter Bayesian settings. In particular,
                 our results imply the first efficiently computable
                 constant-factor approximations to the Bayesian optimal
                 revenue in certain multi-parameter settings.",

                 and we characterize the optimal competitive ratio
                 achievable. The problem considers a sequence of items
                 arriving online that have to be allocated to agents,
                 with different agents bidding different amounts. The
                 objective function is the sum, over each agent i, of a
                 monotonically non-decreasing concave function $M_i: R_?
                 + \to R_+$ of the total amount allocated to $i$. All
                 variants of online matching problems (including the
                 AdWords problem) studied in the literature consider the
                 special case of budgeted linear functions, that is,
                 functions of the form $M_i(u_i) = \min\{u_i, B_i\}$ for
                 some constant $B_i$. The distinguishing feature of this
                 paper is in allowing arbitrary concave returns. The
                 main result of this paper is that for each concave
                 function $M$, there exists a constant $F(M) \leq 1$
                 such that: there exists an algorithm with competitive
                 ratio of $\min_i F(M_i)$, independent of the sequence
                 of items. No algorithm has a competitive ratio larger
                 than $F(M)$ over all instances with $M_i = M$ for all
                 $i$. Our algorithm is based on the primal-dual paradigm
                 and makes use of convex programming duality. The upper
                 bounds are obtained by formulating the task of finding
                 the right counterexample as an optimization problem.
                 This path takes us through the calculus of variations
                 which deals with optimizing over continuous functions.
                 The algorithm and the upper bound are related to each
                 other via a set of differential equations, which points
                 to a certain kind of duality between them.",

                 a rich history spanning quantum mechanics, probability

                 communication complexity, demography, chemometrics,
                 etc. In the past decade NMF has become enormously
                 popular in machine learning, where the factorization is
                 computed using a variety of local search heuristics.
                 Vavasis recently proved that this problem is
                 NP-complete. We initiate a study of when this problem
                 is solvable in polynomial time. Consider a nonnegative
                 $m \times n$ matrix $M$ and a target inner-dimension
                 $r$. Our results are the following: --- We give a
                 polynomial-time algorithm for exact and approximate NMF
                 for every constant $r$. Indeed NMF is most interesting
                 in applications precisely when $r$ is small. We
                 complement this with a hardness result, that if exact
                 NMF can be solved in time $(n m)^{o(r)}$, 3-SAT has a
                 sub-exponential time algorithm. Hence, substantial
                 improvements to the above algorithm are unlikely. ---
                 We give an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in n,
                 $m$ and $r$ under the separability condition identified
                 by Donoho and Stodden in 2003. The algorithm may be
                 practical since it is simple and noise tolerant (under
                 benign assumptions). Separability is believed to hold
                 in many practical settings. To the best of our
                 knowledge, this last result is the first
                 polynomial-time algorithm that provably works under a
                 non-trivial condition on the input matrix and we
                 believe that this will be an interesting and important

                 deterministic, {\em black-box polynomial identity
                 testing algorithms\/} for depth-$3$ set-multilinear
                 circuits (over arbitrary fields). This class of
                 circuits has an efficient, deterministic, white-box
                 polynomial identity testing algorithm (due to Raz and
                 Shpilka [36]), but has no known such black-box
                 algorithm. We recast this problem as a question of
                 finding a low-dimensional subspace $H$, spanned by rank
                 $1$ tensors, such that any non-zero tensor in the dual
                 space $\ker(H)$ has high rank. We obtain explicit
                 constructions of essentially optimal-size hitting sets
                 for tensors of degree $2$ (matrices), and obtain the
                 first quasi-polynomial sized hitting sets for arbitrary
                 tensors.\par

                 We also show connections to the task of performing
                 low-rank recovery of matrices, which is studied in the
                 field of compressed sensing. Low-rank recovery asks
                 (say, over $R$) to recover a matrix $M$ from few
                 measurements, under the promise that $M$ is rank $\leq
                 r$. In this work, we restrict our attention to
                 recovering matrices that are exactly rank $\leq r$
                 using deterministic, non-adaptive, linear measurements,
                 that are free from noise. Over $R$, we provide a set
                 (of size $4 n r$) of such measurements, from which $M$
                 can be recovered in $O(r n^2 + r^3 n)$ field
                 operations, and the number of measurements is
                 essentially optimal. Further, the measurements can be
                 taken to be all rank-$1$ matrices, or all sparse
                 matrices. To the best of our knowledge no explicit
                 constructions with those properties were known prior to
                 this work.\par

                 We also give a more formal connection between low-rank
                 recovery and the task of {\em sparse (vector)
                 recovery\/}: any sparse-recovery algorithm that exactly
                 recovers vectors of length $n$ and sparsity $2 r$,
                 using $m$ non-adaptive measurements, yields a low-rank
                 recovery scheme for exactly recovering $n \times n$
                 matrices of rank $\leq r$, making $2 n m$ non-adaptive
                 measurements. Furthermore, if the sparse-recovery
                 algorithm runs in time $\tau$, then the low-rank
                 recovery algorithm runs in time $O(r n^2 + n \tau)$. We
                 obtain this reduction using linear-algebraic
                 techniques, and not using convex optimization, which is
                 more commonly seen in compressed sensing
                 algorithms.\par

                 Finally, we also make a connection to {\em rank-metric
                 codes}, as studied in coding theory. These are codes
                 with codewords consisting of matrices (or tensors)
                 where the distance of matrices $M$ and $N$ is rank $(M
                 - N)$, as opposed to the usual Hamming metric. We
                 obtain essentially optimal-rate codes over matrices,
                 and provide an efficient decoding algorithm. We obtain
                 codes over tensors as well, with poorer rate, but still
                 with efficient decoding.",

                 arithmetic circuit $\det$ such that the above
                 identities have $P_c(F)$ proofs of polynomial-size and
                 $O(\log^2 n)$ depth. Moreover, there exists an
                 arithmetic formula det of size $n^{O(\log n)}$ such
                 that the above identities have $P_f(F)$ proofs of size
                 $n^{O(\log n)}$.\par

                 This yields a solution to a basic open problem in
                 propositional proof complexity, namely, whether there
                 are polynomial-size NC$^2$-Frege proofs for the
                 determinant identities and the hard matrix identities,
                 as considered, e.g. in Soltys and Cook (2004) (cf.,
                 Beame and Pitassi (1998)). We show that matrix
                 identities like $A B = I \to B A = I$ (for matrices
                 over the two element field) as well as basic properties
                 of the determinant have polynomial-size NC$^2$-Frege
                 proofs, and quasipolynomial-size Frege proofs.",

  abstract =     "An active line of research in proof complexity over
                 the last decade has been the study of proof space and
                 trade-offs between size and space. Such questions were
                 originally motivated by practical SAT solving, but have
                 also led to the development of new theoretical concepts
                 in proof complexity of intrinsic interest and to
                 results establishing nontrivial relations between space
                 and other proof complexity measures. By now, the
                 resolution proof system is fairly well understood in
                 this regard, as witnessed by a sequence of papers
                 leading up to [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom 2008, 2011] and
                 [Beame, Beck, and Impagliazzo 2012]. However, for other
                 relevant proof systems in the context of SAT solving,
                 such as polynomial calculus (PC) and cutting planes
                 (CP), very little has been known. Inspired by [BN08,
                 BN11], we consider CNF encodings of so-called pebble
                 games played on graphs and the approach of making such
                 pebbling formulas harder by simple syntactic
                 modifications. We use this paradigm of hardness
                 amplification to make progress on the relatively
                 longstanding open question of proving time-space
                 trade-offs for PC and CP. Namely, we exhibit a family
                 of modified pebbling formulas $\{F_n\}$ such that: ---
                 The formulas $F_n$ have size $O(n)$ and width $O(1)$.
                 --- They have proofs in length $O(n)$ in resolution,
                 which generalize to both PC and CP. --- Any refutation
                 in CP or PCR (a generalization of PC) in length $L$ and
                 space $s$ must satisfy $s \log L > \approx \sqrt
                 [4]{n}$. A crucial technical ingredient in these
                 results is a new two-player communication complexity
                 lower bound for composed search problems in terms of
                 block sensitivity, a contribution that we believe to be
                 of independent interest.",

  abstract =     "For each natural number $d$ we consider a finite
                 structure $M_d$ whose universe is the set of all $0,
                 1$-sequence of length $n = 2^d$, each representing a
                 natural number in the set $\{0, 1, \ldots{}, 2^n - 1\}$
                 in binary form. The operations included in the
                 structure are the four constants $0$, $1$, $2^n - 1$,
                 $n$, multiplication and addition modulo $2^n$, the
                 unary function $\min\{2^x, 2^n - 1\}$, the binary
                 functions $\lfloor x / y \rfloor$ (with $\lfloor x / 0
                 \rfloor = 0$), $\max(x, y)$, $\min(x, y)$, and the
                 boolean vector operations $\wedge$, $\vee$, [??not??]
                 defined on $0, 1$ sequences of length $n$ by performing
                 the operations on all components simultaneously. These
                 are essentially the arithmetic operations that can be
                 performed on a RAM, with wordlength $n$, by a single
                 instruction. We show that there exists a term (that is,
                 an algebraic expression) $F(x,y)$ built up from the
                 mentioned operations, with the only free variables $x$,
                 $y$, such that for all terms $G(y)$, which is also
                 built up from the mentioned operations, the following
                 holds. For infinitely many positive integers $d$, there
                 exists an $a \in M_d$ such that the following two
                 statements are not equivalent: (i) $M_d \models \exists
                 x, F(x,a)$, (ii) $M_d \models G(a) = 0$. In other
                 words, the question whether an existential statement,
                 depending on the parameter $a \in M_d$ is true or not,
                 cannot be decided by evaluating an algebraic expression
                 at $a$.\par

                 Another way of formulating the theorem, in a slightly
                 stronger form, is, that over the structures $M_d$,
                 quantifier elimination is not possible in the following
                 sense. Let $\cal M$ be a first-order language with
                 equality, containing function symbols for all of the
                 mentioned arithmetic operations. Then there exists an
                 existential first-order formula $\phi(y)$ of $\cal M$,
                 containing a single existential quantifier and the only
                 free variable $y$, such that for each propositional
                 formula $P(y)$ of $\cal M$, we have that for infinitely
                 many positive integers $d$, $\phi(y)$ and $P(y)$ are
                 not equivalent on $M_d$, that is, $M_d \models {\em
                 [not]} \forall y$, $\phi(y) \leftrightarrow
                 P(y)$.\par

                 We also show that the theorem, in both forms, remains
                 true if the binary operation $\min\{x^y, 2^n - 1\}$ is
                 added to the structure $M_d$. A general theorem is
                 proved as well, which describes sufficient conditions
                 for a set of operations on a sequence of structures
                 $K_d$, $d = 1, 2, \ldots{}$ which guarantees that the
                 analogues of the mentioned theorems holds for the
                 structures $K_d$ too.",

                 if and only if the projector into the span of the top

                 the $2 \to q$ norm will refute the Small-Set Expansion
                 Conjecture --- a close variant of the UGC. We also show

                 are efficiently list decodable from a fraction $1 - R -
                 \epsilon$ of adversarial errors where $R$ is the rate
                 of the code, for any desired positive constant
                 $\epsilon$. The worst-case list size output by the
                 algorithm is $O(1 / \epsilon)$, matching the
                 existential bound for random codes up to constant
                 factors. Further, the alphabet size of the codes is a
                 constant depending only on $\epsilon$ --- it can be
                 made $\exp(\tilde{O}(1 / \epsilon^2))$ which is not
                 much worse than the non-constructive $\exp(1 /
                 \epsilon)$ bound of random codes. The code construction
                 is Monte Carlo and has the claimed list decoding
                 property with high probability. Once the code is
                 (efficiently) sampled, the encoding/decoding algorithms
                 are deterministic with a running time $O_{\epsilon}
                 (N^c)$ for an absolute constant $c$, where $N$ is the
                 code's block length. Our construction is based on a
                 careful combination of a linear-algebraic approach to
                 list decoding folded codes from towers of function
                 fields, with a special form of subspace-evasive sets.
                 Instantiating this with the explicit ``asymptotically
                 good'' Garcia--Stichtenoth (GS for short) tower of
                 function fields yields the above parameters. To
                 illustrate the method in a simpler setting, we also
                 present a construction based on Hermitian function
                 fields, which offers similar guarantees with a
                 list-size and alphabet size polylogarithmic in the
                 block length $N$. In comparison, algebraic codes
                 achieving the optimal trade-off between list
                 decodability and rate based on folded Reed--Solomon
                 codes have a decoding complexity of $N^{\Omega(1 /
                 \epsilon)}$, an alphabet size of $N^{\Omega(1 /
                 \epsilon 2)}$, and a list size of $O(1 / \epsilon^2)$
                 (even after combination with subspace-evasive sets).
                 Thus we get an improvement over the previous best
                 bounds in all three aspects simultaneously, and are
                 quite close to the existential random coding bounds.
                 Along the way, we shed light on how to use
                 automorphisms of certain function fields to enable list
                 decoding of the folded version of the associated
                 algebraic-geometric codes.",

                 practical experience, this line of research has gained
                 a lot of attention in the last decade. We consider
                 problems in which $d$ linear and one arbitrary
                 objective function are to be optimized over a set $S
                 \subseteq \{0, 1\}^n$ of feasible solutions. We improve
                 the previously best known bound for the smoothed number
                 of Pareto-optimal solutions to $O(n^{2d} \phi^d)$,

                 distribution over bidders' valuations and provide
                 worst-case (input-by-input) approximation guarantees.
                 In contrast to previous work on this topic, we pursue
                 good prior-free auctions with non-identical bidders.
                 Prior-free auctions can approximate meaningful
                 benchmarks for non-identical bidders only when
                 ``sufficient qualitative information'' about the bidder
                 asymmetry is publicly known. We consider digital goods
                 auctions where there is a total ordering of the bidders
                 that is known to the seller, where earlier bidders are
                 in some sense thought to have higher valuations. We use
                 the framework of Hartline and Roughgarden (STOC '08) to
                 define an appropriate revenue benchmark: the maximum
                 revenue that can be obtained from a bid vector using
                 prices that are nonincreasing in the bidder ordering
                 and bounded above by the second-highest bid. This
                 monotone-price benchmark is always as large as the
                 well-known fixed-price benchmark F$^{(2)}$, so
                 designing prior-free auctions with good approximation
                 guarantees is only harder. By design, an auction that
                 approximates the monotone-price benchmark satisfies a
                 very strong guarantee: it is, in particular,
                 simultaneously near-optimal for essentially every
                 Bayesian environment in which bidders' valuation
                 distributions have nonincreasing monopoly prices, or in
                 which the distribution of each bidder stochastically
                 dominates that of the next. Of course, even if there is
                 no distribution over bidders' valuations, such an
                 auction still provides a quantifiable input-by-input
                 performance guarantee. In this paper, we design a
                 simple prior-free auction for digital goods with
                 ordered bidders, the Random Price Restriction (RPR)
                 auction. We prove that its expected revenue on every
                 bid profile $b$ is $\Omega(M(b) / \log^*n)$, where $M$
                 denotes the monotone-price benchmark and $\log^*n$

                 combinatorial auctions in which the sellers have
                 private costs to produce items, and the buyer
                 (auctioneer) aims to maximize a social valuation
                 function on subsets of items, under the budget
                 constraint on the total payment. One of the most
                 important questions in the field is ``which valuation
                 domains admit truthful budget feasible mechanisms with
                 'small' approximations (compared to the social
                 optimum)?'' Singer [35] showed that additive and
                 submodular functions have a constant approximation
                 mechanism. Recently, Dobzinski, Papadimitriou, and
                 Singer [20] gave an $O(\log^2 n)$ approximation
                 mechanism for subadditive functions; further, they
                 remarked that: ``A fundamental question is whether,
                 regardless of computational constraints, a
                 constant-factor budget feasible mechanism exists for
                 subadditive functions.'' In this paper, we address this
                 question from two viewpoints: prior-free worst case
                 analysis and Bayesian analysis, which are two standard
                 approaches from computer science and economics,
                 respectively. --- For the prior-free framework, we use
                 a linear program (LP) that describes the fractional
                 cover of the valuation function; the LP is also
                 connected to the concept of approximate core in
                 cooperative game theory. We provide a mechanism for
                 subadditive functions whose approximation is $O(I)$,
                 via the worst case integrality gap $I$ of this LP. This
                 implies an $O(\log n)$-approximation for subadditive
                 valuations, $O(1)$-approximation for XOS valuations, as
                 well as for valuations having a constant integrality
                 gap. XOS valuations are an important class of functions
                 and lie between the submodular and the subadditive
                 classes of valuations. We further give another
                 polynomial time $O(\log n / (\log \log n))$
                 sub-logarithmic approximation mechanism for subadditive
                 functions. Both of our mechanisms improve the best
                 known approximation ratio $O(\log^2 n)$. --- For the
                 Bayesian framework, we provide a constant approximation
                 mechanism for all subadditive functions, using the
                 above prior-free mechanism for XOS valuations as a
                 subroutine. Our mechanism allows correlations in the
                 distribution of private information and is universally
                 truthful.",

                 multi-bidder mechanism for independent, additive
                 bidders can be implemented as a mechanism that: (a)
                 allocates every item independently of the other items;
                 (b) for the allocation of each item it uses a strict
                 ordering of all bidders' types; and allocates the item
                 using a distribution over hierarchical mechanisms that
                 iron this ordering into a non-strict ordering, and give
                 the item uniformly at random to the bidders whose
                 reported types dominate all other reported types
                 according to the non-strict ordering. Combined with
                 cyclic-monotonicity our results provide a
                 characterization of feasible, Bayesian Incentive
                 Compatible mechanisms in this setting. Our
                 characterization is enabled by a new, constructive
                 proof of Border's theorem [Border 1991], and a new
                 generalization of this theorem to independent (but not
                 necessarily identically distributed) bidders, improving
                 upon the results of [Border 2007, Che--Kim--Mierendorf
                 2011]. For a single item and independent bidders, we
                 show that every feasible reduced form auction can be
                 implemented as a distribution over hierarchical
                 mechanisms that are consistent with the same strict
                 ordering of all bidders' types, which every mechanism
                 in the support of the distribution irons to a
                 non-strict ordering. We also give a polynomial-time
                 algorithm for determining feasibility of a reduced form
                 auction, or providing a separation hyperplane from the
                 set of feasible reduced forms. To complete the picture,
                 we provide polynomial-time algorithms to find and
                 exactly sample from a distribution over hierarchical
                 mechanisms consistent with a given feasible reduced
                 form. All these results generalize to multi-item
                 reduced form auctions for independent, additive
                 bidders. Finally, for multiple items, additive bidders
                 with hard demand constraints, and arbitrary value
                 correlation across items or bidders, we give a proper
                 generalization of Border's Theorem, and characterize
                 feasible reduced form auctions as multi-commodity flows
                 in related multi-commodity flow instances. We also show
                 that our generalization holds for a broader class of
                 feasibility constraints, including the intersection of
                 any two matroids. As a corollary of our results we
                 compute revenue-optimal, Bayesian Incentive Compatible
                 (BIC) mechanisms in multi-item multi-bidder settings,
                 when each bidder has arbitrarily correlated values over
                 the items and additive valuations over bundles of
                 items, and the bidders are independent. Our mechanisms
                 run in time polynomial in the total number of bidder
                 types (and {not} type profiles). This running time is
                 polynomial in the number of bidders, but potentially
                 exponential in the number of items. We improve the
                 running time to polynomial in both the number of items
                 and the number of bidders by using recent structural
                 results on optimal BIC auctions in item-symmetric
                 settings [Daskalakis--Weinberg 2011].",

                 the interactive information complexity of functions.
                 Let $f(x,y)$ be a function, and suppose Alice is given
                 $x$ and Bob is given $y$. Informally, the interactive
                 information complexity ${\rm IC}(f)$ of $f$ is the
                 least amount of information Alice and Bob need to
                 reveal to each other to compute $f$. Previously,
                 information complexity has been defined with respect to
                 a prior distribution on the input pairs $(x,y)$. Our
                 first goal is to give a definition that is independent
                 of the prior distribution. We show that several
                 possible definitions are essentially equivalent. We
                 establish some basic properties of the interactive
                 information complexity ${\rm IC}(f)$. In particular, we
                 show that ${\rm IC}(f)$ is equal to the amortized
                 (randomized) communication complexity of $f$. We also
                 show a direct sum theorem for ${\rm IC}(f)$ and give

                 complexity and (non-amortized) communication
                 complexity. This connection implies that a non-trivial
                 exchange of information is required when solving
                 problems that have non-trivial communication
                 complexity. We explore the information complexity of
                 two specific problems --- Equality and Disjointness. We
                 show that only a constant amount of information needs
                 to be exchanged when solving Equality with no errors,
                 while solving Disjointness with a constant error
                 probability requires the parties to reveal a linear
                 amount of information to each other.",

                 $\Omega(n/4^k)^{1/8}$ in the Merlin--Arthur model.
                 These lower bounds are close to tight. Previous lower
                 bounds (2007-2008) for $k \geq 3$ parties were weaker
                 than $\Omega(n/2^{k^3})^{1 / (k + 1)}$ in all three

                 This result is optimal with respect to depth and solves

                 randomized algorithm to find a set of $r = \rank(A)$
                 linearly independent columns in $O(|A| + r^w)$ field
                 operations, where $|A|$ denotes the number of nonzero
                 entries in $A$ and $w < 2.38$ is the matrix
                 multiplication exponent. Previously the best known
                 algorithm to find a set of $r$ linearly independent
                 columns is by Gaussian elimination, with running time
                 $O(m n r^w)$. Our algorithm is faster when $r <

                 rectangular. We also consider the problem of computing
                 the rank of a matrix dynamically, supporting the
                 operations of rank one updates and additions and
                 deletions of rows and columns. We present an algorithm

                 block device. The block device can process all items of
                 the same type in a single step. To improve the
                 performance of the system a buffer of size $k$ is used
                 to store items in order to reduce the number of
                 operations required. Whenever the buffer becomes full a

                 then a block operation on all elements with this type
                 that are currently in the buffer is performed. The goal
                 is to design a scheduling strategy that minimizes the

                 all known cases of polynomial time blackbox polynomial
                 identity testing (PIT), that have been hitherto solved
                 using diverse tools and techniques, over fields of zero
                 or large characteristic. In particular, we show that
                 polynomial time hitting-set generators for identity
                 testing of the two seemingly different and well studied
                 models --- depth-3 circuits with bounded top fanin, and
                 constant-depth constant-read multilinear formulas ---
                 can be constructed using one common algebraic-geometry
                 theme: Jacobian captures algebraic independence. By
                 exploiting the Jacobian, we design the first efficient
                 hitting-set generators for broad generalizations of the
                 above-mentioned models, namely:\par

                 (1) depth-3 $(\Omega \Pi \Omega)$ circuits with
                 constant transcendence degree of the polynomials

                 (2) constant-depth constant-{\em occur\/} formulas (no
                 multilinear restriction).\par

                 Constant-{\rm occur} of a variable, as we define it, is
                 a much more general concept than constant-read. Also,
                 earlier work on the latter model assumed that the
                 formula is multilinear. Thus, our work goes further
                 beyond the related results obtained by Saxena \&
                 Seshadhri (STOC 2011), Saraf \& Volkovich (STOC 2011),
                 Anderson et al. (CCC 2011), Beecken et al. (ICALP 2011)

                 one unifying technique.\par

                 In addition, using the same Jacobian based approach, we
                 prove exponential lower bounds for the immanant (which
                 includes permanent and determinant) on the same
                 depth-$3$ and depth-$4$ models for which we give
                 efficient PIT algorithms. Our results reinforce the
                 intimate connection between identity testing and lower
                 bounds by exhibiting a concrete mathematical tool ---
                 the Jacobian --- that is equally effective in solving

                 vector $b$ such that $f(x) = g(Ax + b)$. In other
                 words, if $f$ can be obtained by replacing each
                 variable of $g$ by an affine combination of the
                 variables occurring in $f$, then it is said to be an
                 affine projection of $g$. Some well known problems
                 (such as the determinant versus permanent and matrix
                 multiplication for example) are instances of this
                 problem. Given $f$ and $g$ can we determine whether $f$
                 is an affine projection of $g$? The intention of this
                 paper is to understand the complexity of the

                 $f$ and $g$ find $A$ and $b$ such that $f = g(A x +
                 b)$, if such an $(A b)$ exists. We first show that this
                 is an NP-hard problem. We then focus our attention on
                 instances where $g$ is a member of some fixed, well
                 known family of polynomials so that the input consists
                 only of the polynomial $f(x)$ having $m$ variables and
                 degree $d$. We consider the situation where $f(x)$ is
                 given to us as a blackbox (i.e. for any point $aFm$ we
                 can query the blackbox and obtain $f(a)$ in one step)

                 famous NP-hard optimization problems. We design for
                 this problem a randomized polynomial-time algorithm
                 that computes a $(1 + \mu)$-approximation to the
                 optimal tour, for any fixed $\mu > 0$, in TSP instances

                 intrinsic dimension. The celebrated results of Arora
                 [Aro98] and Mitchell [Mit99] prove that the above
                 result holds in the special case of TSP in a

                 capacities $c_e \geq 1$ for $e \in E$ and a subset $T$
                 of $k$ vertices called terminals, we say that a graph
                 $H$ is a quality-$q$ cut sparsifier for $G$ iff $T
                 \subseteq V(H)$, and for any partition $(A, B)$ of $T$,
                 the values of the minimum cuts separating $A$ and $B$
                 in graphs $G$ and $H$ are within a factor $q$ from each
                 other. We say that $H$ is a quality-$q$ flow sparsifier
                 for $G$ iff $T \subseteq V(H)$, and for any set $D$ of
                 demands over the terminals, the values of the minimum

                 demands in $D$ in graphs $G$ and $H$ are within a
                 factor $q$ from each other.\par

                 So far vertex sparsifiers have been studied in a
                 restricted setting where the sparsifier $H$ is not
                 allowed to contain any non-terminal vertices, that is
                 $V(H) = {\cal T}$. For this setting, efficient
                 algorithms are known for constructing quality-$O(\log
                 k/\log \log k)$ cut and flow vertex sparsifiers, as
                 well as a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\log
                 k})$ on the quality of any flow or cut
                 sparsifier.\par

                 We study flow and cut sparsifiers in the more general
                 setting where Steiner vertices are allowed, that is, we
                 no longer require that $V(H) = {\cal T}$. We show
                 algorithms to construct constant-quality cut
                 sparsifiers of size $O(C^3)$ in time $\poly(n) \cdot
                 2^C$, and constant-quality flow sparsifiers of size
                 $C^{O(\log \log C)}$ in time $n^{O(\log C)} \cdot 2^C$,

                 problem (basic-ICF), we are given an undirected
                 $n$-vertex graph $G$ with edge capacities $c(e)$, a

                 subsets, and for each $1 \leq $i$ \leq k$, a demand
                 D$_i$ is specified. The goal is to find a maximum value
                 $\lambda$ and a collection $P$ of paths, such that for
                 each $i$, at least $\lfloor \lambda \cdot D_i \rfloor$
                 paths connect the vertices of $S_i$ to the vertices of

                 Poisson Binomial Distribution (PBD) over $\{0,
                 1,\ldots{}, n\}$ is the distribution of a sum of $n$
                 independent Bernoulli random variables which may have
                 arbitrary, potentially non-equal, expectations. These
                 distributions were first studied by S. Poisson in 1837
                 and are a natural $n$-parameter generalization of the
                 familiar Binomial Distribution. Surprisingly, prior to
                 our work this basic learning problem was poorly
                 understood, and known results for it were far from
                 optimal. We essentially settle the complexity of the
                 learning problem for this basic class of distributions.
                 As our main result we give a highly efficient algorithm

                 degree-$1$ Fourier coefficients. It has been known
                 since 1961 [Cho61, Tan61] that the (exact values of
                 the) Chow parameters of any linear threshold function
                 $f$ uniquely specify $f$ within the space of all
                 Boolean functions, but until recently [OS11] nothing
                 was known about efficient algorithms for reconstructing
                 $f$ (exactly or approximately) from exact or
                 approximate values of its Chow parameters. We refer to
                 this reconstruction problem as the Chow Parameters
                 Problem. Our main result is a new algorithm for the
                 Chow Parameters Problem which, given (sufficiently
                 accurate approximations to) the Chow parameters of any
                 linear threshold function f, runs in time
                 $\tilde{O}(n^2) o(1/ \epsilon)^{O(\log 2 (1 /
                 \epsilon))}$ and with high probability outputs a
                 representation of an LTF $f'$ that is $\epsilon$-close
                 to $f$. The only previous algorithm [OS11] had running
                 time $\poly(n) \cdot 2^{2 \tilde{O}(1 / \epsilon 2)}$.
                 As a byproduct of our approach, we show that for any
                 linear threshold function $f$ over ${-1,1}^n$, there is
                 a linear threshold function $f'$ which is
                 $\epsilon$-close to $f$ and has all weights that are
                 integers at most $\sqrt n o(1 / \epsilon)^{O(\log 2 (1
                 / \epsilon))}$. This significantly improves the best
                 previous result of [Serv09] which gave a $\poly(n) o
                 2^{O(1 / \epsilon 2/3)}$ weight bound, and is close to
                 the known lower bound of $\max\{\sqrt n, (1 /
                 \epsilon)^{\Omega(\log \log (1 / \epsilon))}\}$
                 [Gol06,Serv07]. Our techniques also yield improved
                 algorithms for related problems in learning theory. In
                 addition to being significantly stronger than previous
                 work, our results are obtained using conceptually
                 simpler proofs. The two main ingredients underlying our
                 results are (1) a new structural result showing that
                 for $f$ any linear threshold function and g any bounded
                 function, if the Chow parameters of $f$ are close to
                 the Chow parameters of $g$ then $f$ is close to g; (2)
                 a new boosting-like algorithm that given approximations
                 to the Chow parameters of a linear threshold function
                 outputs a bounded function whose Chow parameters are
                 close to those of $f$.",

                 reliably compute a given function when the inputs or
                 intermediate computations are subject to noise at a
                 constant rate. Ideally, one would like to use at most a
                 constant factor more resources compared to the
                 noise-free case. This question has been studied for
                 decision trees, circuits, automata, data structures,
                 broadcast networks, communication protocols, and other
                 models. Buhrman et al. (2003) posed the noisy
                 computation problem for real polynomials. We give a
                 complete solution to this problem. For any polynomial
                 $p : \{0, 1\}^n \to [-1, 1]$, we construct a polynomial
                 $p_{\rm robust}: R^n \to R$ of degree $O(\deg p +
                 \log(1 / \epsilon))$ that $\epsilon$-approximates $p$
                 and is robust to noise in the inputs: $|p(x) - p_{\rm
                 robust} (x + \delta)| < \epsilon$ for all $x \in \{0,
                 1\}^n$ and all $\delta \in [-1/3, 1/3]^n$. This result
                 is optimal with respect to all parameters. We construct
                 $p_{\rm robust}$ explicitly for each $p$. Previously,
                 it was open to give such a construction even for $p =
                 x_1 \oplus x_2 \oplus \ldots{} \oplus x_n$ (Buhrman et
                 al., 2003). The proof contributes a technique of
                 independent interest, which allows one to force partial
                 cancellation of error terms in a polynomial.",

                 located in a social network. The payoffs to the firms
                 are the eventual number of adoptions of their product
                 through a competitive stochastic diffusion process in
                 the network. This framework yields a rich class of
                 competitive strategies, which depend in subtle ways on
                 the stochastic dynamics of adoption, the relative
                 budgets of the players, and the underlying structure of
                 the social network. We identify a general property of
                 the adoption dynamics --- namely, decreasing returns to
                 local adoption --- for which the inefficiency of
                 resource use at equilibrium (the Price of Anarchy) is

  abstract =     "The present work deals with the problem of information
                 acquisition in a strategic networked environment. To
                 study this problem, Kleinberg and Raghavan (FOCS 2005)
                 introduced the model of {\em query incentive networks},
                 where the root of a binomial branching process wishes
                 to retrieve an information --- known by each node
                 independently with probability 1/n --- by investing as
                 little as possible. The authors considered {\em
                 fixed-payment contracts\/} in which every node
                 strategically chooses an amount to offer its children
                 paid upon information retrieval to convince them to
                 seek the information in their subtrees. Kleinberg and
                 Raghavan discovered that the investment needed at the
                 root exhibits an unexpected threshold behavior that
                 depends on the branching parameter b. For b > 2, the
                 investment is linear in the expected distance to the
                 closest information (logarithmic in $n$, the rarity of
                 the information), while, for $1 < b < 2$, it becomes
                 exponential in the same distance (i.e., polynomial in
                 $n$). Arcaute et al. (EC 2007) later observed the same
                 threshold behavior for arbitrary Galton--Watson
                 branching processes.\par

                 The DARPA Network Challenge --- retrieving the
                 locations of ten balloons placed at undisclosed
                 positions in the US --- has recently brought practical
                 attention to the problems of social mobilization and
                 information acquisition in a networked environment. The
                 MIT Media Laboratory team won the challenge by acting
                 as the root of a query incentive network that unfolded
                 all over the world. However, rather than adopting a
                 {\em fixed-payment strategy}, the team implemented a
                 different incentive scheme based on {\em $1/2$-split
                 contracts}. Under such incentive scheme, a node $u$ who
                 does not possess the information can recruit a friend
                 $v$ through a contract stipulating that if the
                 information is found in the subtree rooted at $v$, then
                 $v$ has to give half of her own reward back to
                 $u$.\par

                 Motivated by its empirical success, we present a
                 comprehensive theoretical study of this scheme in the
                 game theoretical setting of query incentive networks.
                 Our main result is that split contracts are robust ---
                 as opposed to fixed-payment contracts --- to nodes'
                 selfishness. Surprisingly, when nodes determine the
                 splits to offer their children based on the contracts
                 received from their recruiters, the threshold behavior
                 observed in the previous work vanishes, and an
                 investment linear in the expected distance to the
                 closest information is sufficient to retrieve the
                 information in {\em any arbitrary\/} Galton--Watson
                 process with $b > 1$. Finally, while previous analyses
                 considered the parameters of the branching process as
                 constants, we are able to characterize the rate of the
                 investment in terms of the branching process and the
                 desired probability of success. This allows us to show
                 improvements even in other special cases.",

                 1\}^m$ that each of their outputs depend on a small
                 number of $d$ input bits. While it is known that such
                 generators are likely to exist for the case of small
                 sub-linear stretch $m = n + n^{1 - \delta}$, it is less

                 \Omega(n)$, or even $m = n^{1 + \delta}$ is possible.
                 The existence of such PRGs, which was posed as an open
                 question in previous works, has recently gained an
                 additional motivation due to several interesting
                 applications.\par

                 We make progress towards resolving this question by
                 obtaining several local constructions based on the
                 one-wayness of ``random'' local functions --- a variant
                 of an assumption made by Goldreich (ECCC 2000).
                 Specifically, we construct collections of PRGs with the
                 following parameters:\par

                 1. Linear stretch $m = n + \Omega(n)$ and constant
                 locality $d = O(1)$.\par

                 1. Polynomial stretch $m = n^{1 + \delta}$ and {\em
                 any\/} (arbitrarily slowly growing) super-constant
                 locality $d = \omega(1)$, e.g., $\log^*n$.\par

                 1. Polynomial stretch $m = n^{1 + \delta}$, constant
                 locality $d = O(1)$, and inverse polynomial
                 distinguishing advantage (as opposed to the standard
                 case of $n^{-\omega(1)}$).\par

                 As an additional contribution, we show that our
                 constructions give rise to strong inapproximability
                 results for the densest-subgraph problem in $d$-uniform
                 hypergraphs for constant $d$. This allows us to improve
                 the previous bounds of Feige (STOC 2002) and Khot (FOCS
                 1)    from constant inapproximability factor to
                 $n^\epsilon$-inapproximability, at the expense of
                 relying on stronger assumptions.",

                 in a polynomial-sized set. We show that $B$ is

                 Impagliazzo Hardcore Theorem (FOCS '95) for Shannon
                 entropy (rather than min-entropy).\par

                 Using this characterization, we show that if $f$ is a

                 Plugging this into the construction of Haitner et al.,
                 this yields a simpler construction of pseudorandom
                 generators from one-way functions. In particular, the
                 construction only performs hashing once, and only needs
                 the hash functions that are randomness extractors (e.g.
                 universal hash functions) rather than needing them to
                 support ``local list-decoding'' (as in the
                 Goldreich--Levin hardcore predicate, STOC
                 '89).\par

                 With an additional idea, we also show how to improve
                 the seed length of the pseudorandom generator to
                 $\tilde{O}(n^3)$, compared to $\tilde{O}(n^4)$ in the

                 constructions of such objects and show that they can be
                 used in several applications.\par

                 1. {\bf Improving the output length of known
                 non-malleable extractors.} Non-malleable extractors
                 were introduced in [DW09] to study the problem of
                 privacy amplification with an active adversary.
                 Currently, only two explicit constructions are known
                 [DLWZ11, CRS11]. Both constructions work for $n$ bit
                 sources with min-entropy $k > n / 2$. However, in both
                 constructions the output length is smaller than the
                 seed length, while the probabilistic method shows that
                 to achieve error $\epsilon$, one can use $O(\log n +
                 \log (1 / \epsilon))$ bits to extract up to $k/2$
                 output bits. In this paper, we use our design extractor
                 to give an explicit non-malleable extractor for
                 min-entropy $k > n / 2$, that has seed length $O(\log n
                 + \log (1 / \epsilon))$ and output length
                 $\Omega(k)$.\par

                 1. {\bf Non-malleable condensers.} We introduce and
                 define the notion of a {\em non-malleable condenser}. A
                 non-malleable condenser is a generalization and
                 relaxation of a non-malleable extractor. We show that
                 similar as extractors and condensers, non-malleable
                 condensers can be used to construct non-malleable
                 extractors. We then show that our design extractor
                 already gives a non-malleable condenser for min-entropy
                 $k > n / 2$, with error $\epsilon$ and seed length
                 $O(\log (1 / \epsilon))$.\par

                 1. {\bf A new optimal protocol for privacy
                 amplification.} More surprisingly, we show that
                 non-malleable condensers themselves give optimal
                 privacy amplification protocols with an active
                 adversary. In fact, the non-malleable condensers used
                 in these protocols are much weaker compared to
                 non-malleable extractors, in the sense that the entropy
                 rate of the condenser's output does not need to
                 increase at all. This suggests that one promising next
                 step to achieve better privacy amplification protocols
                 may be to construct non-malleable condensers for
                 smaller min-entropy. As a by-product, we also obtain a
                 new explicit $2$-round privacy amplification protocol
                 with optimal entropy loss and optimal communication
                 complexity for min-entropy $k > n / 2$, without using
                 non-malleable extractors.",

                 improved approximation ratio, surpassing the
                 20-year-old barrier set by the natural Christofides'
                 algorithm variant. Our algorithm also proves an upper
                 bound of $1 + \sqrt 5/2$ on the integrality gap of the
                 path-variant Held--Karp relaxation. The techniques
                 devised in this paper can be applied to other
                 optimization problems as well: these applications
                 include improved approximation algorithms and improved

                 existence of solutions in random constraint
                 satisfaction problems ('CSPs') mostly derive from the
                 first and the second moment method. Yet apart from a
                 very few exceptional cases these methods do not quite
                 yield matching upper and lower bounds. According to
                 deep but non-rigorous arguments from statistical
                 mechanics, this discrepancy is due to a change in the
                 geometry of the set of solutions called condensation
                 that occurs shortly before the actual threshold for the
                 existence of solutions (Krzakala, Montanari,
                 Ricci-Tersenghi, Semerjian, Zdeborova: PNAS~2007). To
                 cope with condensation, physicists have developed a
                 sophisticated but non-rigorous formalism called Survey
                 Propagation (Mezard, Parisi, Zecchina: Science 2002).
                 This formalism yields precise conjectures on the
                 threshold values of many random CSPs. Here we develop a
                 new Survey Propagation inspired second moment method
                 for the random $k$-NAESAT problem, which is one of the
                 standard benchmark problems in the theory of random
                 CSPs. This new technique allows us to overcome the
                 barrier posed by condensation rigorously. We prove that
                 the threshold for the existence of solutions in random
                 $k$-NAESAT is $2^{k-1} \ln 2 - (\ln / 2 2 + 1/4) +
                 \epsilon_k$, where $|\epsilon_k| \leq 2^{-(1 -o

                 of distributed functional monitoring, initiated by
                 Cormode, Muthukrishnan, and Yi (SODA, 2008), and
                 receiving recent attention. In this model there are $k$
                 sites each tracking their input streams and
                 communicating with a central coordinator. The
                 coordinator's task is to continuously maintain an
                 approximate output to a function computed over the
                 union of the $k$ streams. The goal is to minimize the
                 number of bits communicated. Let the $p$-th frequency
                 moment be defined as $F_p = \sum_i f_i^p$, where
                 $f_i$ is the frequency of element $i$. We show the
                 randomized communication complexity of estimating the
                 number of distinct elements (that is, $F_0$) up to a $1
                 + \epsilon$ factor is $\Omega(k / \epsilon^2)$,
                 improving upon the previous $\Omega(k + 1/ \epsilon^2)$
                 bound and matching known upper bounds. For $F_p$, $p >
                 1$, we improve the previous $\Omega(k + 1/ \epsilon^2)$
                 communication bound to $\Omega(k^{p - 1} /
                 \epsilon^2)$. We obtain similar improvements for heavy
                 hitters, empirical entropy, and other problems. Our
                 lower bounds are the first of any kind in distributed
                 functional monitoring to depend on the product of $k$
                 and $1 / \epsilon^2$. Moreover, the lower bounds are
                 for the static version of the distributed functional
                 monitoring model where the coordinator only needs to
                 compute the function at the time when all $k$ input
                 streams end; surprisingly they almost match what is
                 achievable in the (dynamic version of) distributed
                 functional monitoring model where the coordinator needs
                 to keep track of the function continuously at any time
                 step. We also show that we can estimate $F_p$, for any
                 $p > 1$, using $O(k^{p - 1} \poly(\epsilon^{-1}))$
                 communication. This drastically improves upon the
                 previous $O(k^{2 p + 1} N^{1 - 2/p}
                 \poly(\epsilon^{-1}))$ bound of Cormode, Muthukrishnan,
                 and Yi for general $p$, and their $O(k^2 / \epsilon +
                 k^{1.5} / \epsilon^3)$ bound for $p = 2$. For $p = 2$,
                 our bound resolves their main open question. Our lower
                 bounds are based on new direct sum theorems for
                 approximate majority, and yield improvements to
                 classical problems in the standard data stream model.
                 First, we improve the known lower bound for estimating
                 $F_p$, $p > 2$, in $t$ passes from $\Omega(n^{1 - 2 /
                 p} /(\epsilon^{2 / p} t))$ to $\Omega(n^{1 - 2 / p}
                 /(\epsilon^{4 / p} t))$, giving the first bound that
                 matches what we expect when $p = 2$ for any constant
                 number of passes. Second, we give the first lower bound
                 for estimating $F_0$ in $t$ passes with $\Omega(1 /
                 (\epsilon^2 t))$ bits of space that does not use the
                 hardness of the gap-Hamming problem.",

  abstract =     "In this paper, we study the question of how
                 efficiently a collection of interconnected nodes can
                 perform a global computation in the GOSSIP model of
                 communication. In this model, nodes do not know the
                 global topology of the network, and they may only
                 initiate contact with a single neighbor in each round.
                 This model contrasts with the much less restrictive
                 LOCAL model, where a node may simultaneously
                 communicate with all of its neighbors in a single
                 round. A basic question in this setting is how many
                 rounds of communication are required for the
                 information dissemination problem, in which each node
                 has some piece of information and is required to
                 collect all others. In the LOCAL model, this is quite
                 simple: each node broadcasts all of its information in
                 each round, and the number of rounds required will be
                 equal to the diameter of the underlying communication
                 graph. In the GOSSIP model, each node must
                 independently choose a single neighbor to contact, and
                 the lack of global information makes it difficult to
                 make any sort of principled choice. As such,
                 researchers have focused on the uniform gossip
                 algorithm, in which each node independently selects a
                 neighbor uniformly at random. When the graph is
                 well-connected, this works quite well. In a string of
                 beautiful papers, researchers proved a sequence of
                 successively stronger bounds on the number of rounds
                 required in terms of the conductance $\phi$ and graph
                 size $n$, culminating in a bound of $O(\phi^{-1} \log
                 n)$. In this paper, we show that a fairly simple
                 modification of the protocol gives an algorithm that
                 solves the information dissemination problem in at most
                 $O(D + \polylog(n))$ rounds in a network of diameter
                 $D$, with no dependence on the conductance. This is at
                 most an additive polylogarithmic factor from the
                 trivial lower bound of $D$, which applies even in the
                 LOCAL model. In fact, we prove that something stronger
                 is true: any algorithm that requires $T$ rounds in the
                 LOCAL model can be simulated in $O(T + \polylog(n))$
                 rounds in the GOSSIP model. We thus prove that these
                 two models of distributed computation are essentially
                 equivalent.",

                 and lower bounds on the RMR complexity of this problem
                 has been extensively studied. Here, we give matching
                 lower and upper bounds on how RMR complexity trades off
                 with space. Two implications of our results are that
                 constant RMR complexity is impossible with

                 that we design. We then derive lower and upper bounds
                 for this game, thereby obtaining corresponding bounds
                 for mutual exclusion. The lower bounds for the game are

                 elementary proof of existence of equilibrium for this
                 case, i.e., without using fixed point theorems. In

                 setting is that there no longer are ``good'' or
                 ``malicious'' provers, but only rational ones. In
                 essence, the Verifier has a budget $c$ and gives the
                 Prover a reward $r \in [0,c]$ determined by the
                 transcript of their interaction; the prover wishes to

                 maximized only if he the verifier correctly learns

                 that allow investors to hedge risk and speculate on the
                 variation of an asset's future market price. In short,
                 an option has a particular payout that is based on the
                 market price for an asset on a given date in the
                 future. In 1973, Black and Scholes proposed a valuation
                 model for options that essentially estimates the tail
                 risk of the asset price under the assumption that the
                 price will fluctuate according to geometric Brownian
                 motion. A key element of their analysis is that the
                 investor can ``hedge'' the payout of the option by
                 continuously buying and selling the asset depending on
                 the price fluctuations. More recently, DeMarzo et al.
                 proposed a more robust valuation scheme which does not
                 require any assumption on the price path; indeed, in
                 their model the asset's price can even be chosen
                 adversarially. This framework can be considered as a
                 sequential two-player zero-sum game between the
                 investor and Nature. We analyze the value of this game
                 in the limit, where the investor can trade at smaller
                 and smaller time intervals. Under weak assumptions on
                 the actions of Nature (an adversary), we show that the
                 minimax option price asymptotically approaches exactly
                 the Black--Scholes valuation. The key piece of our
                 analysis is showing that Nature's minimax optimal dual
                 strategy converges to geometric Brownian motion in the
                 limit.",

                 Gibbard--Satterthwaite theorem were proven for $k = 3$
                 alternatives by Friedgut, Kalai, Keller and Nisan and
                 for neutral functions on $k \geq 4$ alternatives by
                 Isaksson, Kindler and Mossel. In the present paper we
                 prove a quantitative version of the
                 Gibbard--Satterthwaite theorem for general social
                 choice functions for any number $k \geq 3$ of
                 alternatives. In particular we show that for a social
                 choice function $f$ on $k \geq 3$ alternatives and $n$
                 voters, which is $\epsilon$-far from the family of
                 nonmanipulable functions, a uniformly chosen voter
                 profile is manipulable with probability at least
                 inverse polynomial in $n$, $k$, and $\epsilon^{-1}$.
                 Removing the neutrality assumption of previous theorems
                 is important for multiple reasons. For one, it is known
                 that there is a conflict between anonymity and
                 neutrality, and since most common voting rules are
                 anonymous, they cannot always be neutral. Second,
                 virtual elections are used in many applications in
                 artificial intelligence, where there are often
                 restrictions on the outcome of the election, and so
                 neutrality is not a natural assumption in these
                 situations. Ours is a unified proof which in particular
                 covers all previous cases established before. The proof
                 crucially uses reverse hypercontractivity in addition
                 to several ideas from the two previous proofs. Much of
                 the work is devoted to understanding functions of a
                 single voter, and in particular we also prove a
                 quantitative Gibbard--Satterthwaite theorem for one
                 voter.",

                 monotone functions. The family is essentially defined
                 by the M{\"o}bius action of ${\rm SL}_2(R)$, the group
                 of $2 \times 2$ matrices with determinant one, on the
                 interval $[0, 1]$. No other proof-of-existence for
                 monotone expanders is known, not even using the
                 probabilistic method. The proof extends recent results
                 on finite/compact groups to the non-compact scenario.
                 Specifically, we show a product-growth theorem for

                 standard expander graphs. Dvir and Wigderson proved
                 that it yields the existence of explicit pushdown

  abstract =     "A basic fact in spectral graph theory is that the
                 number of connected components in an undirected graph
                 is equal to the multiplicity of the eigenvalue zero in
                 the Laplacian matrix of the graph. In particular, the
                 graph is disconnected if and only if there are at least
                 two eigenvalues equal to zero. Cheeger's inequality and
                 its variants provide an approximate version of the
                 latter fact; they state that a graph has a sparse cut
                 if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues that
                 are close to zero. It has been conjectured that an
                 analogous characterization holds for higher
                 multiplicities, i.e., there are $k$ eigenvalues close
                 to zero if and only if the vertex set can be
                 partitioned into $k$ subsets, each defining a sparse
                 cut. We resolve this conjecture. Our result provides a
                 theoretical justification for clustering algorithms
                 that use the bottom $k$ eigenvectors to embed the
                 vertices into R$^k$, and then apply geometric
                 considerations to the embedding. We also show that
                 these techniques yield a nearly optimal quantitative
                 connection between the expansion of sets of size
                 $\approx n/k$ and $\lambda_k$, the $k$th smallest
                 eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian, where $n$ is
                 the number of vertices. In particular, we show that in
                 every graph there are at least $k / 2$ disjoint sets
                 (one of which will have size at most $2 n / k$), each
                 having expansion at most $O(\sqrt{\lambda_k \log k})$.
                 Louis, Raghavendra, Tetali, and Vempala have
                 independently proved a slightly weaker version of this
                 last result [LRTV12]. The $\sqrt{\log k}$ bound is

                 consisting of a spectral projection and a randomized
                 rounding. As a consequence, we get the same upper bound

                 possible up to constant factors.\par

                 The underlying algorithmic problem, namely finding $k$

                 the balanced (edge-)separator problem that, given a
                 graph $G$, a constant balance $b \in (0,1/2]$, and a
                 parameter $\gamma$, either finds an
                 $\Omega(b)$-balanced cut of conductance $O(\sqrt

                 $b$-balanced cuts in $G$ have conductance at least
                 $\gamma$, and runs in time $\tilde{O}(m)$. This settles
                 the question of designing asymptotically optimal
                 spectral algorithms for balanced separator. Our
                 algorithm relies on a variant of the heat kernel random
                 walk and requires, as a subroutine, an algorithm to
                 compute $\exp(-L) v$ where $L$ is the Laplacian of a
                 graph related to $G$ and $v$ is a vector. Algorithms
                 for computing the matrix-exponential-vector product
                 efficiently comprise our next set of results. Our main
                 result here is a new algorithm which computes a good
                 approximation to $\exp(-A) v$ for a class of symmetric
                 positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices $A$ and a given
                 vector $v$, in time roughly $\tilde{O}(m_A)$,
                 independent of the norm of $A$, where $m_A$ is the
                 number of non-zero entries of $A$. This uses, in a
                 non-trivial way, the result of Spielman and Teng on
                 inverting symmetric and diagonally-dominant matrices in
                 $\tilde{O}(m_A)$ time. Finally, using old and new
                 uniform approximations to $e^{-x}$ we show how to
                 obtain, via the Lanczos method, a simple algorithm to
                 compute $\exp(-A) v$ for symmetric PSD matrices that
                 runs in time roughly $O(t_A \cdot \sqrt{\norm(A)})$,
                 where $t_A$ is the time required for the computation of
                 the vector $A w$ for given vector w. As an application,
                 we obtain a simple and practical algorithm, with output
                 conductance $O(\sqrt \gamma)$, for balanced separator
                 that runs in time $O(m / \sqrt \gamma)$. This latter
                 algorithm matches the running time, but improves on the
                 approximation guarantee of the Evolving-Sets-based
                 algorithm by Andersen and Peres for balanced
                 separator.",

  abstract =     "Until recently, LP relaxations have only played a very
                 limited role in the design of approximation algorithms
                 for the Steiner tree problem. In particular, no
                 (efficiently solvable) Steiner tree relaxation was
                 known to have an integrality gap bounded away from $2$,
                 before Byrka et al. [3] showed an upper bound of
                 $\approx 1.55$ of a hypergraphic LP relaxation and
                 presented a $\ln(4) + \epsilon \approx 1.39$
                 approximation based on this relaxation. Interestingly,
                 even though their approach is LP based, they do not
                 compare the solution produced against the LP
                 value.\par

                 We take a fresh look at hypergraphic LP relaxations for
                 the Steiner tree problem --- one that heavily exploits
                 methods and results from the theory of matroids and
                 submodular functions --- which leads to stronger
                 integrality gaps, faster algorithms, and a variety of
                 structural insights of independent interest. More
                 precisely, along the lines of the algorithm of Byrka et
                 al.[3], we present a deterministic $\ln(4) + \epsilon$
                 approximation that compares against the LP value and
                 therefore proves a matching $\ln(4)$ upper bound on the
                 integrality gap of hypergraphic
                 relaxations.\par

                 Similarly to [3], we iteratively fix one component and
                 update the LP solution. However, whereas in [3] the LP
                 is solved at every iteration after contracting a
                 component, we show how feasibility can be maintained by
                 a greedy procedure on a well-chosen matroid. Apart from
                 avoiding the expensive step of solving a hypergraphic
                 LP at each iteration, our algorithm can be analyzed
                 using a simple potential function. This potential
                 function gives an easy means to determine stronger
                 approximation guarantees and integrality gaps when
                 considering restricted graph topologies. In particular,
                 this readily leads to a $73/60 \approx 1.217$ upper
                 bound on the integrality gap of hypergraphic
                 relaxations for quasi-bipartite
                 graphs.\par

                 Additionally, for the case of quasi-bipartite graphs,
                 we present a simple algorithm to transform an optimal
                 solution to the bidirected cut relaxation to an optimal
                 solution of the hypergraphic relaxation, leading to a
                 fast $73/60$ approximation for quasi-bipartite graphs.
                 Furthermore, we show how the separation problem of the
                 hypergraphic relaxation can be solved by computing
                 maximum flows, which provides a way to obtain a fast
                 independence oracle for the matroids that we use in our
                 approach.",

                 from the set $\{1, \ldots{}, r\}$ are to be stored in
                 an array of size $m \geq n$. The items are presented
                 sequentially in an arbitrary order, and must be stored
                 in the array in sorted order (but not necessarily in
                 consecutive locations in the array). Each new item must
                 be stored in the array before the next item is
                 received. If $r \leq m$ then we can simply store item
                 $j$ in location $j$ but if $r > m$ then we may have to
                 shift the location of stored items to make space for a
                 newly arrived item. The algorithm is charged each time
                 an item is stored in the array, or moved to a new
                 location. The goal is to minimize the total number of
                 such moves the algorithm has to do. This problem is
                 non-trivial when $n \leq m < r$. In the case that $m =
                 Cn$ for some $C > 1$, algorithms for this problem with
                 cost $O(\log(n)^2)$ per item have been given [Itai et
                 al. (1981), Willard (1992), Bender et al. (2002)]. When
                 $m = n$, algorithms with cost $O(\log(n)^3)$ per item
                 were given [Zhang (1993),Bird and Sadnicki (2007)]. In
                 this paper we prove lower bounds that show that these
                 algorithms are optimal, up to constant factors.
                 Previously, the only lower bound known for this range
                 of parameters was a lower bound of $\Omega(\log(n)^2)$
                 for the restricted class of smooth algorithms [Dietz et
                 al. (2005), Zhang (1993)]. We also provide an algorithm
                 for the sparse case: If the number of items is

                 be solved in amortized constant time per item.",

                 from $[1,M]$ and parameter $\epsilon > 0$, our
                 forbidden-set labeling scheme uses labels of length
                 $\lambda = O(\epsilon^{-1} \log^2 n \log (n M) \cdot
                 \log n)$. Given the labels of two vertices $s$ and $t$
                 and of a set $F$ of faulty vertices\slash edges, our
                 scheme approximates the distance between $s$ and $t$ in
                 $G \backslash F$ with stretch $(1 + \epsilon)$, in
                 $O(|F|^2 \lambda)$ time.\par

                 We then present a general method to transform $(1 +
                 \epsilon)$ forbidden-set labeling schemas into a fully
                 dynamic $(1 + \epsilon)$ distance oracle. Our fully
                 dynamic $(1 + \epsilon)$ distance oracle is of size
                 $O(n \log n \cdot (\epsilon^{-1} + \log n))$ and has
                 $\tilde{O}(n^{1/2})$ query and update time, both the
                 query and the update time are worst case. This improves
                 on the best previously known $(1 + \epsilon)$ dynamic
                 distance oracle for planar graphs, which has worst case
                 query time $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ and amortized update
                 time of $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$.\par

                 Our $(1 + \epsilon)$ forbidden-set labeling scheme can
                 also be extended into a forbidden-set labeled routing
                 scheme with stretch $(1 + \epsilon)$.",

  abstract =     "We propose a new notion of secure multiparty
                 computation aided by a computationally-powerful but
                 untrusted ``cloud'' server. In this notion that we call
                 on-the-fly multiparty computation (MPC), the cloud can
                 non-interactively perform arbitrary, dynamically chosen
                 computations on data belonging to arbitrary sets of
                 users chosen on-the-fly. All user's input data and
                 intermediate results are protected from snooping by the
                 cloud as well as other users. This extends the standard
                 notion of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), where
                 users can only enlist the cloud's help in evaluating
                 functions on their own encrypted data. In on-the-fly
                 MPC, each user is involved only when initially
                 uploading his (encrypted) data to the cloud, and in a
                 final output decryption phase when outputs are
                 revealed; the complexity of both is independent of the
                 function being computed and the total number of users
                 in the system. When users upload their data, they need
                 not decide in advance which function will be computed,
                 nor who they will compute with; they need only
                 retroactively approve the eventually-chosen functions
                 and on whose data the functions were evaluated. This
                 notion is qualitatively the best possible in minimizing
                 interaction, since the users' interaction in the
                 decryption stage is inevitable: we show that removing
                 it would imply generic program obfuscation and is thus
                 impossible. Our contributions are two-fold:- We show
                 how on-the-fly MPC can be achieved using a new type of
                 encryption scheme that we call multikey FHE, which is
                 capable of operating on inputs encrypted under
                 multiple, unrelated keys. A ciphertext resulting from a
                 multikey evaluation can be jointly decrypted using the
                 secret keys of all the users involved in the
                 computation. --- We construct a multikey FHE scheme
                 based on NTRU, a very efficient public-key encryption
                 scheme proposed in the 1990s. It was previously not
                 known how to make NTRU fully homomorphic even for a
                 single party. We view the construction of (multikey)
                 FHE from NTRU encryption as a main contribution of
                 independent interest. Although the transformation to a
                 fully homomorphic system deteriorates the efficiency of
                 NTRU somewhat, we believe that this system is a leading
                 candidate for a practical FHE scheme.",

                 to learn nothing beyond the input and output values of
                 corrupted parties. This is in contrast with previous
                 works on leakage in the multi-party protocol setting,
                 which weaken the security notion, and only guarantee
                 that a protocol which leaks $l$ bits about the parties'
                 secret states, yields at most $l$ bits of leakage on
                 the parties' private inputs. For some functions, such
                 as voting, such leakage can be detrimental. Our result

                 private mechanisms for a set of $d$ linear queries over
                 a database, while adding as little error as possible.
                 Hardt and Talwar [HT10] related this problem to
                 geometric properties of a convex body defined by the
                 set of queries and gave a $O(\log^3 d)$-approximation
                 to the minimum $l_2^2$ error, assuming a conjecture
                 from convex geometry called the Slicing or Hyperplane
                 conjecture. In this work we give a mechanism that works
                 unconditionally, and also gives an improved $O(\log^2
                 d)$ approximation to the expected $l_2^2$ error. We
                 remove the dependence on the Slicing conjecture by
                 using a result of Klartag [Kla06] that shows that any
                 convex body is close to one for which the conjecture
                 holds; our main contribution is in making this result
                 constructive by using recent techniques of Dadush,
                 Peikert and Vempala [DPV10]. The improvement in
                 approximation ratio relies on a stronger lower bound we
                 derive on the optimum. This new lower bound goes beyond
                 the packing argument that has traditionally been used
                 in Differential Privacy and allows us to add the
                 packing lower bounds obtained from orthogonal
                 subspaces. We are able to achieve this via a
                 symmetrization argument which argues that there always
                 exists a near optimal differentially private mechanism
                 which adds noise that is independent of the input
                 database! We believe this result should be of
                 independent interest, and also discuss some interesting

                 $p \in P$, and a {\em range space\/} ${\cal R}

                 the output is $R(x) = \sum_{p \in R} x_p$. The {\em

                 R(x))^2$. Range counting for different range spaces is
                 a central problem in Computational Geometry.\par

                 We study $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private
                 algorithms for range counting. Our main results are for
                 the range space given by hyperplanes, that is, the
                 halfspace counting problem. We present an $(\epsilon,
                 \delta)$-differentially private algorithm for halfspace
                 counting in $d$ dimensions which is $O(n^{1 - 1/d})$
                 approximate for average squared error. This contrasts
                 with the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound established by the
                 classical result of Dinur and Nissim on approximation
                 for arbitrary subset counting queries. We also show a
                 matching lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1 - 1 /d})$
                 approximation for any $(\epsilon,
                 \delta)$-differentially private algorithm for halfspace
                 counting.\par

                 Both bounds are obtained using discrepancy theory. For
                 the lower bound, we use a modified discrepancy measure
                 and bound approximation of $(\epsilon,
                 \delta)$-differentially private algorithms for range
                 counting queries in terms of this discrepancy. We also
                 relate the modified discrepancy measure to classical
                 combinatorial discrepancy, which allows us to exploit
                 known discrepancy lower bounds. This approach also
                 yields a lower bound of $\Omega((\log n)^{d - 1})$ for
                 $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private {\em
                 orthogonal\/} range counting in $d$ dimensions, the
                 first known superconstant lower bound for this problem.
                 For the upper bound, we use an approach inspired by
                 partial coloring methods for proving discrepancy upper
                 bounds, and obtain $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially

                 functions of low-degree polynomials have received a lot

                 constructing PRGs for the natural class of polynomial

                 Goemans and Linial and studied in the seminal work of
                 Arora, Rao and Vazirani [3] has an integrality gap of $
                 \exp (\Omega ((\log \log n)^{1 / 2})) $. Understanding
                 the performance of the Goemans--Linial SDP for uniform
                 sparsest cut is an important open problem in
                 approximation algorithms and metric embeddings. Our

  abstract =     "We study connections between Natural Proofs,
                 derandomization, and the problem of proving ``weak''
                 circuit lower bounds such as $ {\rm NEXP} \not \subset
                 {\rm TC}^0 $, which are still wide open. Natural Proofs
                 have three properties: they are constructive (an
                 efficient algorithm $A$ is embedded in them), have
                 largeness ($A$ accepts a large fraction of strings),
                 and are useful ($A$ rejects all strings which are truth
                 tables of small circuits). Strong circuit lower bounds
                 that are ``naturalizing'' would contradict present
                 cryptographic understanding, yet the vast majority of
                 known circuit lower bound proofs are naturalizing. So
                 it is imperative to understand how to pursue un-Natural
                 Proofs. Some heuristic arguments say constructivity
                 should be circumventable. Largeness is inherent in many
                 proof techniques, and it is probably our presently weak
                 techniques that yield constructivity. We prove:
                 Constructivity is unavoidable, even for NEXP lower
                 bounds. Informally, we prove for all ``typical''
                 non-uniform circuit classes $C$, $ {\rm NEXP} \not
                 \subset C $ if and only if there is a polynomial-time
                 algorithm distinguishing some function from all
                 functions computable by $C$-circuits. Hence $ {\rm
                 NEXP} \not \subset C $ is equivalent to exhibiting a
                 constructive property useful against $C$. There are no
                 P-natural properties useful against $C$ if and only if
                 randomized exponential time can be ``derandomized''
                 using truth tables of circuits from $C$ as random
                 seeds. Therefore the task of proving there are no
                 $P$-natural properties is inherently a derandomization
                 problem, weaker than but implied by the existence of
                 strong pseudorandom functions. These characterizations
                 are applied to yield several new results. The two main
                 applications are that $ {\rm NEXP} \cap {\rm coNEXP} $
                 does not have $ n^{\log n} $ size ACC circuits, and a
                 mild derandomization result for RP.",

  abstract =     "Motivated by certain applications from physics,
                 biochemistry, economics, and computer science in which
                 the objects under investigation are unknown or not
                 directly accessible because of various limitations, we
                 propose a trial-and-error model to examine search
                 problems in which inputs are unknown. More
                 specifically, we consider constraint satisfaction
                 problems $ \wedge_i C_i $, where the constraints $ C_i
                 $ are hidden, and the goal is to find a solution
                 satisfying all constraints. We can adaptively propose a
                 candidate solution (i.e., trial), and there is a
                 verification oracle that either confirms that it is a
                 valid solution, or returns the index i of a violated
                 constraint (i.e., error), with the exact content of $
                 C_i $ still hidden. We studied the time and trial
                 complexities of a number of natural CSPs, summarized as
                 follows. On one hand, despite the seemingly very little
                 information provided by the oracle, efficient
                 algorithms do exist for Nash, Core, Stable Matching,
                 and SAT problems, whose unknown-input versions are
                 shown to be as hard as the corresponding known-input
                 versions up to a factor of polynomial. The techniques
                 employed vary considerably, including, e.g., order
                 theory and the ellipsoid method with a strong
                 separation oracle. On the other hand, there are
                 problems whose complexities are substantially increased
                 in the unknown-input model. In particular, no
                 time-efficient algorithms exist for Graph Isomorphism
                 and Group Isomorphism (unless PH collapses or P = NP).
                 The proofs use quite nonstandard reductions, in which
                 an efficient simulator is carefully designed to
                 simulate a desirable but computationally unaffordable
                 oracle. Our model investigates the value of input
                 information, and our results demonstrate that the lack
                 of input information can introduce various levels of
                 extra difficulty. The model accommodates a wide range
                 of combinatorial and algebraic structures, and exhibits
                 intimate connections with (and hopefully can also serve
                 as a useful supplement to) certain existing learning
                 and complexity theories.",

                 a collection of indivisible objects is to be priced and
                 sold to potential buyers subject to equilibrium
                 constraints. The classic solution concept for such
                 problems is Walrasian Equilibrium (WE), which provides
                 a simple and transparent pricing structure that
                 achieves optimal social welfare. The main weakness of
                 the WE notion is that it exists only in very
                 restrictive cases. To overcome this limitation, we
                 introduce the notion of a Combinatorial Walrasian
                 equilibium (CWE), a natural relaxation of WE. The
                 difference between a CWE and a (non-combinatorial) WE
                 is that the seller can package the items into
                 indivisible bundles prior to sale, and the market does
                 not necessarily clear. We show that every valuation
                 profile admits a CWE that obtains at least half of the
                 optimal (unconstrained) social welfare. Moreover, we
                 devise a poly-time algorithm that, given an arbitrary
                 allocation X, computes a CWE that achieves at least
                 half of the welfare of X. Thus, the economic problem of
                 finding a CWE with high social welfare reduces to the
                 algorithmic problem of social-welfare approximation. In
                 addition, we show that every valuation profile admits a
                 CWE that extracts a logarithmic fraction of the optimal
                 welfare as revenue. Finally, these results are
                 complemented by strong lower bounds when the seller is
                 restricted to using item prices only, which motivates
                 the use of bundles. The strength of our results derives
                 partly from their generality --- our results hold for
                 arbitrary valuations that may exhibit complex
                 combinations of substitutes and complements.",

                 and for $ l_p $, via a subspace-preserving sampling

  abstract =     "We give near-tight lower bounds for the sparsity
                 required in several dimensionality reducing linear
                 maps. First, consider the Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL)
                 lemma which states that for any set of $n$ vectors in $
                 R^d $ there is an $ A \in R^{m \times d} $ with $ m =
                 O(\epsilon^{-2} \log n) $ such that mapping by $A$
                 preserves the pairwise Euclidean distances up to a $ 1
                 \pm \epsilon $ factor. We show there exists a set of
                 $n$ vectors such that any such $A$ with at most $s$
                 non-zero entries per column must have $ s = \Omega
                 (\epsilon^{-1} \log n / \log (1 / \epsilon)) $ if $ m <
                 O(n / \log (1 / \epsilon)) $. This improves the lower
                 bound of $ \Omega (\min \{ \epsilon^{-2}, \epsilon^{-1}
                 \sqrt (\log_m d) \}) $ by [Dasgupta-Kumar-Sarlos, STOC
                 2010], which only held against the stronger property of
                 distributional JL, and only against a certain
                 restricted class of distributions. Meanwhile our lower
                 bound is against the JL lemma itself, with no
                 restrictions. Our lower bound matches the sparse JL
                 upper bound of [Kane-Nelson, SODA 2012] up to an $
                 O(\log (1 / \epsilon)) $ factor. Next, we show that any
                 $ m \times n $ matrix with the $k$-restricted isometry
                 property (RIP) with constant distortion must have $
                 \Omega (k \log (n / k)) $ non-zeroes per column if $ m
                 = O(k \log (n / k)) $, the optimal number of rows for
                 RIP, and $ k < n / \polylog n $. This improves the
                 previous lower bound of $ \Omega (\min \{ k, n / m \})
                 $ by [Chandar, 2010] and shows that for most $k$ it is
                 impossible to have a sparse RIP matrix with an optimal
                 number of rows. Both lower bounds above also offer a
                 tradeoff between sparsity and the number of rows.
                 Lastly, we show that any oblivious distribution over
                 subspace embedding matrices with 1 non-zero per column
                 and preserving distances in a $d$ dimensional-subspace
                 up to a constant factor must have at least $ \Omega
                 (d^2) $ rows. This matches an upper bound in
                 [Nelson-Nguy{\^e}n, arXiv abs/1211.1002] and shows the
                 impossibility of obtaining the best of both of
                 constructions in that work, namely 1 non-zero per
                 column and $ d \cdot \polylog d $ rows.",

                 that is essentially independent of that required for
                 classical NP verification. In particular, they provide
                 strong solutions to the problem of verifiably
                 delegating computation. We construct the first
                 fully-succinct publicly-verifiable SNARK. To do that,
                 we first show how to ``bootstrap'' any SNARK that
                 requires expensive preprocessing to obtain a SNARK that
                 does not, while preserving public verifiability. We
                 then apply this transformation to known SNARKs with
                 preprocessing. Moreover, the SNARK we construct only
                 requires of the prover time and space that are
                 essentially the same as that required for classical NP
                 verification. Our transformation assumes only
                 collision-resistant hashing; curiously, it does not
                 rely on PCPs. We also show an analogous transformation
                 for privately-verifiable SNARKs, assuming
                 fully-homomorphic encryption. At the heart of our
                 transformations is a technique for recursive
                 composition of SNARKs. This technique uses in an
                 essential way the proof-carrying data (PCD) framework,
                 which extends SNARKs to the setting of distributed
                 networks of provers and verifiers. Concretely, to
                 bootstrap a given SNARK, we recursively compose the
                 SNARK to obtain a ``weak'' PCD system for shallow
                 distributed computations, and then use the PCD
                 framework to attain stronger notions of SNARKs and PCD
                 systems.",

                 turn an $n$-dimensional input into a concise
                 lower-dimensional representation via a linear
                 transformation. Such sketches have seen a wide range of
                 applications including norm estimation over data
                 streams, compressed sensing, and distributed computing.
                 In almost any realistic setting, however, a linear
                 sketch faces the possibility that its inputs are
                 correlated with previous evaluations of the sketch.
                 Known techniques no longer guarantee the correctness of
                 the output in the presence of such correlations. We
                 therefore ask: Are linear sketches inherently
                 non-robust to adaptively chosen inputs? We give a
                 strong affirmative answer to this question.
                 Specifically, we show that no linear sketch
                 approximates the Euclidean norm of its input to within
                 an arbitrary multiplicative approximation factor on a
                 polynomial number of adaptively chosen inputs. The
                 result remains true even if the dimension of the sketch
                 is d=n-o(n) and the sketch is given unbounded
                 computation time. Our result is based on an algorithm
                 with running time polynomial in d that adaptively finds
                 a distribution over inputs on which the sketch is
                 incorrect with constant probability. Our result implies
                 several corollaries for related problems including
                 l$_p$ -norm estimation and compressed sensing. Notably,
                 we resolve an open problem in compressed sensing
                 regarding the feasibility of l$_2$ /l$_2$ -recovery
                 guarantees in presence of computationally bounded

                 set intersection problem on subsets of $ \{ 1, \ldots

                 interest in proving unconditional lower bounds against
                 any linear program. Fiorini et al. proved that there is
                 no polynomial sized linear program for traveling
                 salesman. Braun et al. proved that there is no
                 polynomial sized $ O(n^{1 / 2 - \epsilon })
                 $-approximate linear program for clique. Here we prove
                 an optimal and unconditional lower bound against linear
                 programs for clique that matches Hastad's celebrated
                 hardness result. Interestingly, the techniques used to
                 prove such lower bounds have closely followed the
                 progression of techniques used in communication
                 complexity. Here we develop an information theoretic
                 framework to approach these questions, and we use it to
                 prove our main result. Also we resolve a related
                 question: How many bits of communication are needed to
                 get $ \epsilon $ advantage over random guessing for
                 disjointness? Kalyanasundaram and Schnitger proved that
                 a protocol that gets constant advantage requires $
                 \Omega (n) $ bits of communication. This result in
                 conjunction with amplification implies that any
                 protocol that gets $ \epsilon $-advantage requires $
                 \Omega (\epsilon^2 n) $ bits of communication. Here we
                 improve this bound to $ \Omega (\epsilon n) $, which is

                 prices in Exchange (Arrow--Debreu) markets. In this
                 paper we define a class of markets for which
                 tatonnement is equivalent to gradient descent. This is
                 the class of markets for which there is a convex
                 potential function whose gradient is always equal to
                 the negative of the excess demand and we call it Convex
                 Potential Function (CPF) markets. We show the following
                 results. CPF markets contain the class of Eisenberg
                 Gale (EG) markets, defined previously by Jain and
                 Vazirani. The subclass of CPF markets for which the
                 demand is a differentiable function contains exactly
                 those markets whose demand function has a symmetric
                 negative semi-definite Jacobian. We define a family of
                 continuous versions of tatonnement based on gradient
                 descent using a Bregman divergence. As we show, all
                 processes in this family converge to an equilibrium for
                 any CPF market. This is analogous to the classic result
                 for markets satisfying the Weak Gross Substitutes
                 property. A discrete version of tatonnement converges
                 toward the equilibrium for the following markets of
                 complementary goods; its convergence rate for these
                 settings is analyzed using a common potential function.
                 Fisher markets in which all buyers have Leontief
                 utilities. The tatonnement process reduces the distance
                 to the equilibrium, as measured by the potential
                 function, to an $ \epsilon $ fraction of its initial
                 value in $ O(1 / \epsilon) $ rounds of price updates.
                 Fisher markets in which all buyers have complementary
                 CES utilities. Here, the distance to the equilibrium is

                 value in $ O(\log (1 / \epsilon)) $ rounds of price
                 updates. This shows that tatonnement converges for the
                 entire range of Fisher markets when buyers have
                 complementary CES utilities, in contrast to prior work,
                 which could analyze only the substitutes range,

                 procedures for allocating items to bidders with
                 potentially complex preferences. In a simultaneous
                 auction, every bidder submits independent bids on all
                 items simultaneously. The allocation and prices are
                 then resolved for each item separately, based solely on
                 the bids submitted on that item. We study the
                 efficiency of Bayes-Nash equilibrium (BNE) outcomes of
                 simultaneous first- and second-price auctions when
                 bidders have complement-free (a.k.a. subadditive)
                 valuations. While it is known that the social welfare
                 of every pure Nash equilibrium (NE) constitutes a
                 constant fraction of the optimal social welfare, a pure
                 NE rarely exists, and moreover, the full information
                 assumption is often unrealistic. Therefore, quantifying
                 the welfare loss in Bayes-Nash equilibria is of
                 particular interest. Previous work established a
                 logarithmic bound on the ratio between the social
                 welfare of a BNE and the expected optimal social
                 welfare in both first-price auctions (Hassidim et al.,
                 2011) and second-price auctions (Bhawalkar and
                 Roughgarden, 2011), leaving a large gap between a
                 constant and a logarithmic ratio. We introduce a new
                 proof technique and use it to resolve both of these
                 gaps in a unified way. Specifically, we show that the
                 expected social welfare of any BNE is at least 1/2 of
                 the optimal social welfare in the case of first-price
                 auctions, and at least 1/4 in the case of second-price
                 auctions.",

                 can be thought of as mechanisms that generate

                 relying on the non-black-box simulation technique of
                 Barak (FOCS'01). Similar to the protocol of Barak, ours
                 is public-coin, is based on the existence of
                 collision-resistant hash functions, and, is not based
                 on ``rewinding techniques'' but rather uses
                 non-black-box simulation. However in contrast to the
                 protocol of Barak, our protocol is secure even if there
                 are any unbounded (polynomial) number of concurrent
                 sessions. This gives us the first construction of
                 public-coin concurrent zero-knowledge. Prior to our
                 work, Pass, Tseng and Wikstrom (SIAM J. Comp. 2011) had
                 shown that using black-box simulation, getting a
                 construction for even public-coin parallel
                 zero-knowledge is impossible. A public-coin concurrent
                 zero-knowledge protocol directly implies the existence
                 of a concurrent resettably-sound zero-knowledge
                 protocol. This is an improvement over the corresponding
                 construction of Deng, Goyal and Sahai (FOCS'09) which
                 was based on stronger assumptions. Furthermore, this
                 also directly leads to an alternative (and arguable
                 cleaner) construction of a simultaneous resettable
                 zero-knowledge argument system. An important feature of
                 our protocol is the existence of a ``straight-line''
                 simulator. This gives a fundamentally different tool
                 for constructing concurrently secure computation
                 protocols (for functionalities even beyond
                 zero-knowledge). The round complexity of our protocol
                 is $ n^\epsilon $ (for any constant $ \epsilon > 0 $ ),
                 and, the simulator runs in strict polynomial time. The

                 Micali and Rackoff, is of fundamental importance to
                 modern cryptography. In a breakthrough work from 2001,
                 Barak (FOCS'01) introduced a novel non-black-box
                 simulation technique. This technique enabled the
                 construction of new cryptographic primitives, such as
                 resettably-sound zero-knowledge arguments, that cannot
                 be proven secure using just black-box simulation
                 techniques. The work of Barak and its follow-ups,
                 however, all require stronger cryptographic hardness
                 assumptions than the minimal assumption of one-way
                 functions. In this work, we show how to perform
                 non-black-box simulation assuming just the existence of
                 one-way functions. In particular, we demonstrate the

  abstract =     "The traditional notion of program obfuscation requires
                 that an obfuscation \char`{\~P}rog of a program Prog
                 computes the exact same function as Prog, but beyond
                 that, the code of \char`{\~P}rog should not leak any
                 information about Prog. This strong notion of virtual
                 black-box security was shown by Barak et al. (CRYPTO
                 2001) to be impossible to achieve, for certain
                 unobfuscatable function families. The same work raised
                 the question of approximate obfuscation, where the
                 obfuscated \char`{\~P}rog is only required to
                 approximate Prog; that is, \char`{\~P}rog only agrees
                 with Prog with high enough probability on some input
                 distribution. We show that, assuming trapdoor
                 permutations, there exist families of robust
                 unobfuscatable functions for which even approximate
                 obfuscation is impossible. Specifically, obfuscation is
                 impossible even if the obfuscated \char`{\~P}rog is
                 only required to agree with Prog with probability
                 slightly more than 1/2, on a uniformly sampled input
                 (below 1/2-agreement, the function obfuscated by
                 \char`{\~P}rog is not uniquely defined). Additionally,
                 assuming only one-way functions, we rule out
                 approximate obfuscation where \char`{\~P}rog may output
                 bot with probability close to $1$, but otherwise must
                 agree with Prog. We demonstrate the power of robust
                 unobfuscatable functions by exhibiting new implications
                 to resettable protocols. Concretely, we reduce the
                 assumptions required for resettably-sound
                 zero-knowledge to one-way functions, as well as reduce
                 round-complexity. We also present a new simplified
                 construction of a simultaneously-resettable
                 zero-knowledge protocol. Finally, we construct a
                 three-message simultaneously-resettable
                 witness-indistinguishable argument of knowledge (with a
                 non-black-box knowledge extractor). Our constructions
                 use a new non-black-box simulation technique that is
                 based on a special kind of ``resettable slots''. These
                 slots are useful for a non-black-box simulator, but not
                 for a resetting prover.",

  abstract =     "A Steiner 2-design is a finite geometry consisting of
                 a set of ``points'' together with a set of ``lines''
                 (subsets of points of uniform cardinality) such that
                 each pair of points belongs to exactly one line. In
                 this paper we analyse the individualization/refinement
                 heuristic and conclude that after individualizing $
                 O(\log n) $ points (assigning individual colors to
                 them), the refinement process gives each point an
                 individual color. The following consequences are
                 immediate: (a) isomorphism of Steiner 2-designs can be
                 tested in $ n^{O(\log n)} $ time, where $n$ is the
                 number of lines; (b) a canonical form of Steiner
                 2-designs can be computed within the same time bound;
                 (c) all isomorphisms between two Steiner 2-designs can
                 be listed within the same time bound; (d) the number of
                 automorphisms of a Steiner 2-design is at most
                 n$^{O(\log n)}$ (a fact of interest to finite geometry
                 and group theory.) The best previous bound in each of
                 these four statements was moderately exponential, $
                 \exp (\tilde O(n^{1 / 4})) $ (Spielman, STOC'96). Our
                 result removes an exponential bottleneck from
                 Spielman's analysis of the Graph Isomorphism problem
                 for strongly regular graphs. The results extend to
                 Steiner $t$-designs for all $ t \geq 2 $. Strongly
                 regular (s.r.) graphs have been known as hard cases for
                 graph isomorphism testing; the best previously known
                 bound for this case is moderately exponential, $ \exp
                 (\tilde O(n^{1 / 3})) $ where $n$ is the number of
                 vertices (Spielman, STOC'96). Line graphs of Steiner
                 $2$-designs enter as a critical subclass via Neumaier's
                 1979 classification of s.r. graphs. Previously, $
                 n^{O(\log n)} $ isomorphism testing and canonical forms
                 for Steiner 2-designs was known for the case when the
                 lines of the Steiner 2-design have bounded length
                 (Babai and Luks, STOC'83). That paper relied on Luks's
                 group-theoretic divide-and-conquer algorithms and did
                 not yield a subexponential bound on the number of
                 automorphisms. To analyse the
                 individualization/refinement heuristic, we develop a
                 new structure theory of Steiner 2-designs based on the
                 analysis of controlled growth and on an addressing
                 scheme that produces a hierarchy of increasing sets of
                 pairwise independent, uniformly distributed points.
                 This scheme represents a new expression of the
                 structural homogeneity of Steiner 2-designs that allows
                 applications of the second moment method. We also
                 address the problem of reconstruction of Steiner
                 2-designs from their line-graphs beyond the point of
                 unique reconstructability, in a manner analogous to
                 list-decoding, and as a consequence achieve an $ \exp
                 (\tilde O(n^{1 / 6})) $ bound for isomorphism testing
                 for this class of s.r. graphs. Results, essentially
                 identical to our main results, were obtained
                 simultaneously by Xi Chen, Xiaorui Sun, and Shang-Hua
                 Teng, building on a different philosophy and
                 combinatorial structure theory than the present paper.
                 They do not claim an analysis of the
                 individualization/refinement algorithm but of a more
                 complex combinatorial algorithm. We comment on how this
                 paper fits into the overall project of improved
                 isomorphism testing for strongly regular graphs (the
                 ultimate goal being subexponential $ \exp (n^{o(1)}) $
                 time). In the remaining cases we need to deal with s.r.
                 graphs satisfying ``Neumaier's claw bound,'' permitting
                 the use of a separate set of asymptotic structural
                 tools. In joint work (in progress) with Chen, Sun, and
                 Teng, we address that case and have already pushed the
                 overall bound below $ \exp (\tilde O(n^{1 / 4})) $ The
                 present paper is a methodologically distinct and

  abstract =     "A standard heuristic for testing graph isomorphism is
                 to first assign distinct labels to a small set of
                 vertices of an input graph, and then propagate to
                 create new vertex labels across the graph, aiming to
                 assign distinct and isomorphism-invariant labels to all
                 vertices in the graph. This is usually referred to as
                 the individualization/refinement method for canonical
                 labeling of graphs. We present a quasipolynomial-time
                 algorithm for isomorphism testing of Steiner 2-systems.
                 A Steiner 2-system consists of points and lines, where
                 each line passes the same number of points and each
                 pair of points uniquely determines a line. Each Steiner
                 2-system induces a Steiner graph, in which vertices
                 represent lines and edges represent intersections of
                 lines. Steiner graphs are an important subfamily of
                 strongly regular graphs whose isomorphism testing has
                 challenged researchers for years. Inspired by both the
                 individualization/refinement method and the previous
                 analyses of Babai and Spielman, we consider an extended
                 framework for isomorphism testing of Steiner 2-systems,
                 in which we use a small set of randomly chosen points
                 and lines to build isomorphism-invariant multi-stage
                 combinatorial structures that are sufficient to
                 distinguish all pairs of points of a Steiner 2-system.
                 Applying this framework, we show that isomorphism of
                 Steiner 2-systems with $n$ lines can be tested in time
                 $\smash n^{O(\log n)}$, improving the previous best
                 bound of $ \smash \exp (\tilde O(n^{1 / 4})) $ by
                 Spielman. Before our result, quasipolynomial-time
                 isomorphism testing was only known for the case when
                 the line size is polylogarithmic, as shown by Babai and
                 Luks. A result essentially identical to ours was
                 obtained simultaneously by Laszlo Babai and John
                 Wilmes. They performed a direct analysis of the
                 individualization/refinement method, building on a
                 different philosophy and combinatorial structure
                 theory. We comment on how this paper fits into the
                 overall project of improved isomorphism testing for
                 strongly regular graphs (the ultimate goal being
                 subexponential $ \exp (n^{o(1)}) $ time). In the
                 remaining cases, we only need to deal with strongly
                 regular graphs satisfying ``Neumaier's claw bound,''
                 permitting the use of a separate set of asymptotic
                 structural tools. In joint work (in progress) with

                 This improves on the previous $ 2^{2 k} $ approximation
                 in time $ \poly (n) 2^{O(k)} $ due to Chlamtac et al.
                 [18]. To complement this algorithm, we show the
                 following hardness results: If the non-uniform Sparsest
                 Cut has a $ \rho $-approximation for series-parallel
                 graphs (where $ \rho \geq 1 $ ), then the MaxCut
                 problem has an algorithm with approximation factor
                 arbitrarily close to $ 1 / \rho $. Hence, even for such
                 restricted graphs (which have treewidth 2), the
                 Sparsest Cut problem is NP-hard to approximate better
                 than $ 17 / 16 - \epsilon $ for $ \epsilon > 0 $;
                 assuming the Unique Games Conjecture the hardness
                 becomes $ 1 / \alpha_{GW} - \epsilon $. For graphs with
                 large (but constant) treewidth, we show a hardness
                 result of $ 2 - \epsilon $ assuming the Unique Games
                 Conjecture. Our algorithm rounds a linear program based
                 on (a subset of) the Sherali--Adams lift of the
                 standard Sparsest Cut LP. We show that even for
                 treewidth-2 graphs, the LP has an integrality gap close
                 to 2 even after polynomially many rounds of
                 Sherali--Adams. Hence our approach cannot be improved
                 even on such restricted graphs without using a stronger

                 Connectivity matrix $ H_t $ is a matrix that has rows
                 and columns both labeled by all perfect matchings of
                 the complete graph $ K_t $ on $t$ vertices; an entry $
                 H_t [M_1, M_2] $ is $1$ if $ M_1 \cup M_2 $ is a
                 Hamiltonian cycle and $0$ otherwise. Motivated by the
                 computational study of the Hamiltonicity problem, we
                 present three results on the structure of $ H_t $: We
                 first show that $ H_t $ has rank exactly $ 2^{t / 2 -
                 1} $ over GF(2) via an appropriate factorization that
                 explicitly provides families of matchings $ X_t $
                 forming bases for $ H_t $. Second, we show how to
                 quickly change representation between such bases.
                 Third, we notice that the sets of matchings $ X_t $
                 induce permutation matrices within $ H_t $. We use the
                 factorization to derive an $ 1.888^n n^{O(1)} $ time
                 Monte Carlo algorithm that solves the Hamiltonicity
                 problem in directed bipartite graphs. Our algorithm as
                 well counts the number of Hamiltonian cycles modulo two
                 in directed bipartite or undirected graphs in the same
                 time bound. Moreover, we use the fast basis change
                 algorithm from the second result to present a Monte
                 Carlo algorithm that given an undirected graph on $n$
                 vertices along with a path decomposition of width at
                 most pw decides Hamiltonicity in $ (2 + \sqrt 2)^{pw}
                 n^{O(1)} $ time. Finally, we use the third result to
                 show that for every $ \epsilon > 0 $ this cannot be
                 improved to $ (2 + \sqrt 2 - \epsilon)^{pw} n^{O(1)} $

                 fails, i.e., a faster algorithm for this problem would

                 $C$ (consisting of alternating layers of $ \Sigma $ and

                 settles this question, not only for depth-3 but, up to
                 depth $ \epsilon \log s / \log \log s $, for a fixed

                 formulas over a Hadamard algebra, after applying a

                 a rich class of queries that includes contingency
                 tables and range queries and has been the focus of a
                 long line of work. For a given set of $d$ linear
                 queries over a database $ x \in R^N $, we seek to find
                 the differentially private mechanism that has the
                 minimum mean squared error. For pure differential
                 privacy, [5, 32] give an $ O(\log^2 d) $ approximation
                 to the optimal mechanism. Our first contribution is to
                 give an efficient $ O(\log^2 d) $ approximation
                 guarantee for the case of $ (\epsilon, \delta)
                 $-differential privacy. Our mechanism adds carefully
                 chosen correlated Gaussian noise to the answers. We
                 prove its approximation guarantee relative to the
                 hereditary discrepancy lower bound of [44], using tools
                 from convex geometry. We next consider the sparse case
                 when the number of queries exceeds the number of
                 individuals in the database, i.e. when $ d > n \Delta
                 |x|_1 $. The lower bounds used in the previous
                 approximation algorithm no longer apply --- in fact
                 better mechanisms are known in this setting [7, 27, 28,
                 31, 49]. Our second main contribution is to give an
                 efficient $ (\epsilon, \delta) $-differentially private
                 mechanism that, for any given query set $A$ and an
                 upper bound $n$ on $ |x|_1 $, has mean squared error
                 within $ \polylog (d, N) $ of the optimal for $A$ and
                 $n$. This approximation is achieved by coupling the
                 Gaussian noise addition approach with linear regression
                 over the $ l_1 $ ball. Additionally, we show a similar
                 polylogarithmic approximation guarantee for the optimal
                 $ \epsilon $-differentially private mechanism in this
                 sparse setting. Our work also shows that for arbitrary
                 counting queries, i.e. $A$ with entries in $ \{ 0, 1 \}
                 $, there is an $ \epsilon $-differentially private
                 mechanism with expected error $ \tilde O(\sqrt n) $ per
                 query, improving on the $ \tilde O(n^{2 / 3}) $ bound
                 of [7] and matching the lower bound implied by [15] up
                 to logarithmic factors. The connection between the
                 hereditary discrepancy and the privacy mechanism
                 enables us to derive the first polylogarithmic
                 approximation to the hereditary discrepancy of a matrix

                 construct the bottom-$k$ sample of their union as S$_k$
                 (A union B)=S$_k$ (S$_k$ (A) union S$_k$ (B)), and then
                 the similarity is estimated as |S$_k$ (A union B)
                 intersect S$_k$ (A) intersect S$_k$ (B)|/k. We show
                 here that even if the hash function is only
                 2-independent, the expected relative error is $ O(1
                 \sqrt (f_k)) $. For $ f_k = \Omega(1) $ this is
                 within a constant factor of the expected relative error
                 with truly random hashing. For comparison, consider the
                 classic approach of kxmin-wise where we use $k$ hash
                 independent functions $ h_1, \ldots {}, h_k $, storing
                 the smallest element with each hash function. For
                 kxmin-wise there is an at least constant bias with
                 constant independence, and it is not reduced with
                 larger $k$. Recently Feigenblat et al. showed that
                 bottom-$k$ circumvents the bias if the hash function is
                 8-independent and $k$ is sufficiently large. We get
                 down to 2-independence for any $k$. Our result is based
                 on a simply union bound, transferring generic
                 concentration bounds for the hashing scheme to the
                 bottom-$k$ sample, e.g., getting stronger probability
                 error bounds with higher independence. For weighted
                 sets, we consider priority sampling which adapts
                 efficiently to the concrete input weights, e.g.,
                 benefiting strongly from heavy-tailed input. This time,
                 the analysis is much more involved, but again we show
                 that generic concentration bounds can be applied.",

                 Byzantine asynchronous systems is well-understood when
                 all values lie on the real line. In this paper, we
                 generalize the problem to consider values that lie in $
                 R^m $, for $ m \geq 1 $, and present an optimal
                 protocol in regard to fault tolerance. Our scenario is
                 the following. Processes start with values in $ R^m $,
                 for $ m \geq 1 $, and communicate via message-passing.
                 The system is asynchronous: there is no upper bound on
                 processes' relative speeds or on message delay. Some
                 faulty processes can display arbitrarily malicious
                 (i.e. Byzantine) behavior. Non-faulty processes must
                 decide on values that are: (1) in $ R^m $; (2) within
                 distance $ \epsilon $ of each other; and (3) in the
                 convex hull of the non-faulty processes' inputs. We
                 give an algorithm with a matching lower bound on fault
                 tolerance: we require $ n > t(m + 2) $, where $n$ is
                 the number of processes, $t$ is the number of Byzantine
                 processes, and input and output values reside in $ R^m

                 non-faulty inputs projected at coordinate $d$. The

                 and its special case, the hypercube, is a classic
                 question in property testing. We are given query access
                 to $ f : [k]^n \to R $ (for some ordered range $R$).
                 The hypergrid/cube has a natural partial order given by
                 coordinate-wise ordering, denoted by prec. A function
                 is monotone if for all pairs $ x \prec y $, $ f(x) \leq
                 f(y) $. The distance to monotonicity, $ \epsilon_f $,
                 is the minimum fraction of values of $f$ that need to
                 be changed to make f monotone. For $ k = 2 $ (the
                 boolean hypercube), the usual tester is the edge
                 tester, which checks monotonicity on adjacent pairs of
                 domain points. It is known that the edge tester using $
                 O(\epsilon^{-1} n \log |R|) $ samples can distinguish a
                 monotone function from one where $ \epsilon_f >
                 \epsilon $. On the other hand, the best lower bound for
                 monotonicity testing over general $R$ is $ \Omega (n)
                 $. We resolve this long standing open problem and prove
                 that $ O(n / \epsilon) $ samples suffice for the edge
                 tester. For hypergrids, known testers require $
                 O(\epsilon^{-1} n \log k \log |R|) $ samples, while the
                 best known (non-adaptive) lower bound is $ \Omega
                 (\epsilon^{-1} n \log k) $. We give a (non-adaptive)
                 monotonicity tester for hypergrids running in $
                 O(\epsilon^{{-1} n \log k}) $ time. Our techniques lead
                 to optimal property testers (with the same running
                 time) for the natural Lipschitz property on hypercubes
                 and hypergrids. (A $c$-Lipschitz function is one where
                 $ |f(x) - f(y)| \leq c || x - y ||_1 $.) In fact, we
                 give a general unified proof for $ O(\epsilon^{-1} n

                 characterizations are testable. In fact, we show a
                 proximity-oblivious test for any such property cP,

                 a product of d linear polynomials, and whether a

                 degree-structural properties and are therefore locally

                 with large Gowers norm into a function of a small
                 number of low-degree non-classical polynomials. We
                 establish a new equidistribution result for high rank
                 non-classical polynomials that drives the proofs of

  abstract =     "Testing a property $P$ of graphs in the bounded-degree
                 model deals with the following problem: given a graph
                 $G$ of bounded degree $d$, we should distinguish (with
                 probability 2/3, say) between the case that $G$
                 satisfies P and the case that one should add/remove at
                 least $ \epsilon d n $ edges of $G$ to make it satisfy
                 $P$. In sharp contrast to property testing of dense
                 graphs, which is relatively well understood, only few
                 properties are known to be testable with a constant
                 number of queries in the bounded-degree model. In
                 particular, no global monotone (i.e., closed under edge
                 deletions) property that expander graphs can satisfy
                 has been shown to be testable in constant time so far.
                 In this paper, we identify for the first time a natural
                 family of global monotone property that expander graphs
                 can satisfy and can be efficiently tested in the
                 bounded degree model. Specifically, we show that, for
                 any integer $ t \geq 1 $, $ K_t $-subdivision-freeness
                 is testable with a constant number of queries in the
                 bounded-degree model. This property was not previously
                 known to be testable even with o(n) queries. Note that
                 an expander graph with all degree less than $ t - 1 $
                 does not have a $ K_t $-subdivision. The proof is based
                 on a novel combination of some results that develop the
                 framework of partitioning oracles, together with
                 structural graph theory results that develop the
                 seminal graph minor theory by Robertson and Seymour. As
                 far as we aware, this is the first result that bridges
                 property testing and structural graph theory. Although
                 we know a rough structure for graphs without $H$-minors
                 from the famous graph minor theory by Robertson and
                 Seymour, there is no corresponding structure theorem
                 for graphs without $H$-subdivisions so far, even $ K_5

                 fastest combinatorial algorithm for both parameters
                 works by solving the all-pairs shortest paths problem
                 (APSP) and has a running time of $ \tilde O(m n) $ in
                 $m$-edge, $n$-node graphs. In a seminal paper,
                 Aingworth, Chekuri, Indyk and Motwani [SODA'96 and
                 SICOMP'99] presented an algorithm that computes in $
                 \tilde O(m \sqrt n + n^2) $ time an estimate $D$ for
                 the diameter $D$, such that $ \lfloor 2 / 3 D \rfloor
                 \leq^D \leq D $. Their paper spawned a long line of
                 research on approximate APSP. For the specific problem
                 of diameter approximation, however, no improvement has
                 been achieved in over 15 years. Our paper presents the
                 first improvement over the diameter approximation
                 algorithm of Aingworth et. al, producing an algorithm
                 with the same estimate but with an expected running
                 time of $ \tilde O(m \sqrt n) $. We thus show that for
                 all sparse enough graphs, the diameter can be
                 3/2-approximated in $ o(n^2) $ time. Our algorithm is
                 obtained using a surprisingly simple method of
                 neighborhood depth estimation that is strong enough to
                 also approximate, in the same running time, the radius
                 and more generally, all of the eccentricities, i.e. for
                 every node the distance to its furthest node. We also
                 provide strong evidence that our diameter approximation
                 result may be hard to improve. We show that if for some
                 constant $ \epsilon > 0 $ there is an $ O(m^{2 -
                 \epsilon }) $ time $ (3 / 2 - \epsilon) $-approximation
                 algorithm for the diameter of undirected unweighted
                 graphs, then there is an $ O*((2 - \delta)^n) $ time
                 algorithm for CNF-SAT on $n$ variables for constant $
                 \delta > 0 $, and the strong exponential time
                 hypothesis of [Impagliazzo, Paturi, Zane JCSS'01] is
                 false. Motivated by this negative result, we give
                 several improved diameter approximation algorithms for
                 special cases. We show for instance that for unweighted
                 graphs of constant diameter $D$ not divisible by $3$,
                 there is an $ O(m^{2 - \epsilon }) $ time algorithm
                 that gives a $ (3 / 2 - \epsilon) $ approximation for
                 constant $ \epsilon > 0 $. This is interesting since
                 the diameter approximation problem is hardest to solve
                 for small $D$.",

  abstract =     "In the online Steiner tree problem, a sequence of
                 points is revealed one-by-one: when a point arrives, we
                 only have time to add a single edge connecting this
                 point to the previous ones, and we want to minimize the
                 total length of edges added. Here, a tight bound has
                 been known for two decades: the greedy algorithm
                 maintains a tree whose cost is $ O(\log n) $ times the
                 Steiner tree cost, and this is best possible. But
                 suppose, in addition to the new edge we add, we have
                 time to change a single edge from the previous set of
                 edges: can we do much better? Can we, e.g., maintain a
                 tree that is constant-competitive? We answer this
                 question in the affirmative. We give a primal-dual
                 algorithm that makes only a single swap per step (in
                 addition to adding the edge connecting the new point to
                 the previous ones), and such that the tree's cost is
                 only a constant times the optimal cost. Our dual-based
                 analysis is quite different from previous primal-only
                 analyses. In particular, we give a correspondence
                 between radii of dual balls and lengths of tree edges;
                 since dual balls are associated with points and hence
                 do not move around (in contrast to edges), we can
                 closely monitor the edge lengths based on the dual
                 radii. Showing that these dual radii cannot change too
                 rapidly is the technical heart of the paper, and allows

                 of special vertices called terminals. This problem is
                 NP-hard and there is a well known geometric relaxation
                 in which the graph is embedded into a high dimensional

                 is based on em competing exponential clocks and

  abstract =     "Garbled circuits, introduced by Yao in the mid 80s,
                 allow computing a function f on an input x without
                 leaking anything about f or x besides f(x). Garbled
                 circuits found numerous applications, but every known
                 construction suffers from one limitation: it offers no
                 security if used on multiple inputs x. In this paper,
                 we construct for the first time reusable garbled
                 circuits. The key building block is a new succinct
                 single-key functional encryption scheme. Functional
                 encryption is an ambitious primitive: given an
                 encryption $ {\rm Enc}(x) $ of a value $x$, and a
                 secret key $ {\rm sk}_f $ for a function $f$, anyone
                 can compute $ f(x) $ without learning any other
                 information about $x$. We construct, for the first
                 time, a succinct functional encryption scheme for {\em
                 any} polynomial-time function f where succinctness
                 means that the ciphertext size does not grow with the
                 size of the circuit for $f$, but only with its depth.
                 The security of our construction is based on the
                 intractability of the Learning with Errors (LWE)
                 problem and holds as long as an adversary has access to
                 a single key $ {\rm sk}_f $ (or even an a priori
                 bounded number of keys for different functions).
                 Building on our succinct single-key functional
                 encryption scheme, we show several new applications in
                 addition to reusable garbled circuits, such as a
                 paradigm for general function obfuscation which we call
                 token-based obfuscation, homomorphic encryption for a
                 class of Turing machines where the evaluation runs in
                 input-specific time rather than worst-case time, and a
                 scheme for delegating computation which is publicly
                 verifiable and maintains the privacy of the
                 computation.",

                 algorithmic core that enables fast verification of long
                 computations in many cryptographic constructions. Yet,
                 despite the wonderful asymptotic savings they bring,
                 PCPs are also the infamous computational bottleneck
                 preventing these powerful cryptographic constructions
                 from being used in practice. To address this problem,
                 we present several results about the computational
                 efficiency of PCPs. We construct the first PCP where
                 the prover and verifier time complexities are
                 quasi-optimal (i.e., optimal up to poly-logarithmic
                 factors). The prover and verifier are also
                 highly-parallelizable, and these computational
                 guarantees hold even when proving and verifying the
                 correctness of random-access machine computations. Our
                 construction is explicit and has the requisite
                 properties for being used in the cryptographic
                 applications mentioned above. Next, to better
                 understand the efficiency of our PCP, we propose a new
                 efficiency measure for PCPs (and their major
                 components, locally-testable codes and PCPs of
                 proximity). We define a concrete-efficiency threshold
                 that indicates the smallest problem size beyond which
                 the PCP becomes ``useful'', in the sense that using it
                 is cheaper than performing naive verification (i.e.,
                 rerunning the computation); our definition accounts for
                 both the prover and verifier complexity. We then show
                 that our PCP has a finite concrete-efficiency
                 threshold. That such a PCP exists does not follow from
                 existing works on PCPs with polylogarithmic-time
                 verifiers. As in [Ben-Sasson and Sudan, STOC '05], PCPs
                 of proximity for Reed--Solomon (RS) codes are the main
                 component of our PCP. We construct a PCP of proximity
                 that reduces the concrete-efficiency threshold for
                 testing proximity to RS codes from 2$^{683}$ in their
                 work to 2$^{43}$, which is tantalizingly close to

                 topology, with connections to combinatorial and
                 geometric questions, from the point of view of
                 computational complexity. The extension problem asks,
                 given topological spaces $X$, $Y$, a subspace $ A
                 \subseteq X $, and a (continuous) map $ f : A \to Y $,
                 whether $f$ can be extended to a map $ X \to Y $. For
                 computational purposes, we assume that X and Y are
                 represented as finite simplicial complexes, $A$ is a
                 subcomplex of $X$, and $f$ is given as a simplicial
                 map. In this generality the problem is undecidable, as
                 follows from Novikov's result from the 1950s on
                 uncomputability of the fundamental group $ \pi_1 (Y) $.
                 We thus study the problem under the assumption that,
                 for some $ k \geq 2 $, $Y$ is $ (k - 1) $-connected;
                 informally, this means that $Y$ has ``no holes up to
                 dimension $ k - 1 $'' i.e., the first $ k - 1 $
                 homotopy groups of $Y$ vanish (a basic example of such
                 a $Y$ is the sphere $ S^k $). We prove that, on the
                 one hand, this problem is still undecidable for $ \dim
                 X = 2 k $. On the other hand, for every fixed $ k \geq
                 2 $, we obtain an algorithm that solves the extension
                 problem in polynomial time assuming $Y$ $ (k - 1)
                 $-connected and $ \dim X \leq 2 k - 1 $. For $ \dim X
                 \leq 2 k - 2 $, the algorithm also provides a
                 classification of all extensions up to homotopy
                 (continuous deformation). This relies on results of our
                 SODA 2012 paper, and the main new ingredient is a
                 machinery of objects with polynomial-time homology,
                 which is a polynomial-time analog of objects with
                 effective homology developed earlier by Sergeraert et
                 al. We also consider the computation of the higher
                 homotopy groups $ \pi_k (Y) $, $ k \geq 2 $, for a
                 1-connected $Y$. Their computability was established by
                 Brown in 1957; we show that $ \pi_k(Y) $ can be
                 computed in polynomial time for every fixed $ k \geq 2
                 $. On the other hand, Anick proved in 1989 that
                 computing $ \pi_k(Y) $ is \#P-hard if $k$ is a part of
                 input, where $Y$ is a cell complex with certain rather
                 compact encoding. We strengthen his result to

                 studied problems in Computational Geometry, such as
                 $k$-center clustering and furthest nearest neighbor.
                 The new approach is robust to variations in the input
                 problem, and yet it is simple, elegant and practical.
                 In particular, many of these well studied problems
                 which fit easily into our framework, either previously
                 had no linear time approximation algorithm, or required
                 rather involved algorithms and analysis. A short list
                 of the problems we consider include furthest nearest
                 neighbor, $k$-center clustering, smallest disk
                 enclosing k points, $k$-th largest distance, $k$-th
                 smallest $m$-nearest neighbor distance, $k$-th heaviest
                 edge in the MST and other spanning forest type
                 problems, problems involving upward closed set systems,
                 and more. Finally, we show how to extend our framework
                 such that the linear running time bound holds with high
                 probability.",

  abstract =     "The paper concerns lattice triangulations, i.e.,
                 triangulations of the integer points in a polygon in $
                 R^2 $ whose vertices are also integer points. Lattice
                 triangulations have been studied extensively both as
                 geometric objects in their own right and by virtue of
                 applications in algebraic geometry. Our focus is on
                 random triangulations in which a triangulation $ \sigma
                 $ has weight $ \lambda^{| \sigma |} $, where $ \lambda
                 $ is a positive real parameter and $ | \sigma | $ is
                 the total length of the edges in $ \sigma $.
                 Empirically, this model exhibits a ``phase transition''
                 at $ \lambda = 1 $ (corresponding to the uniform
                 distribution): for $ \lambda < 1 $ distant edges behave
                 essentially independently, while for $ \lambda > 1 $
                 very large regions of aligned edges appear. We
                 substantiate this picture as follows. For $ \lambda < 1
                 $ sufficiently small, we show that correlations between
                 edges decay exponentially with distance (suitably
                 defined), and also that the Glauber dynamics (a local
                 Markov chain based on flipping edges) is rapidly mixing
                 (in time polynomial in the number of edges). This
                 dynamics has been proposed by several authors as an
                 algorithm for generating random triangulations. By
                 contrast, for $ \lambda > 1 $ we show that the mixing
                 time is exponential. These are apparently the first
                 rigorous quantitative results on spatial mixing
                 properties and dynamics of random lattice
                 triangulations.",

                 signatures. They turned out to be essential to the
                 complete classification of Holant problems. The
                 dichotomy theorem has an explicit tractability
                 criterion. A Holant problem defined by a set of

                 if it satisfies this tractability criterion, and is
                 \#P-hard otherwise. The tractability criterion can be
                 intuitively stated as follows: A set {F} is tractable
                 if (1) every function in {F} has arity at most two, or
                 (2) {F} is transformable to an affine type, or (3) {F}

                 vanishing, combined with the right type of binary
                 functions, or (5) {F} belongs to a special category of
                 vanishing type Fibonacci gates. The proof of this

                 Holant problems and Boolean \#CSP. Holographic
                 transformations play an indispensable role, not only as

                 most basic and well-studied parameters of geometric
                 spanners. In a seminal STOC'95 paper, titled
                 ``Euclidean spanners: short, thin and lanky'', Arya et
                 al. [2] devised a construction of Euclidean $ (1 +
                 \epsilon) $-spanners that achieves constant degree,
                 diameter $ O(\log n) $, weight $ O(\log^2 n) \cdot
                 \omega ({\rm MST}) $, and has running time $ O(n \cdot
                 \log n) $. This construction applies to $n$-point
                 constant-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Moreover, Arya
                 et al. conjectured that the weight bound can be
                 improved by a logarithmic factor, without increasing
                 the degree and the diameter of the spanner, and within
                 the same running time. This conjecture of Arya et al.
                 became one of the most central open problems in the
                 area of Euclidean spanners. Nevertheless, the only
                 progress since 1995 towards its resolution was achieved
                 in the lower bounds front: Any spanner with diameter $
                 O(\log n) $ must incur weight $ \Omega (\log n) \cdot
                 \omega ({\rm MST}) $, and this lower bound holds
                 regardless of the stretch or the degree of the spanner
                 [12, 1]. In this paper we resolve the long-standing
                 conjecture of Arya et al. in the affirmative. We
                 present a spanner construction with the same stretch,
                 degree, diameter, and running time, as in Arya et al.'s
                 result, but with optimal weight $ O(\log n) \cdot
                 \omega ({\rm MST}) $. So our spanners are as thin and
                 lanky as those of Arya et al., but they are really
                 short! Moreover, our result is more general in three
                 ways. First, we demonstrate that the conjecture holds
                 true not only in constant-dimensional Euclidean spaces,
                 but also in doubling metrics. Second, we provide a
                 general tradeoff between the three involved parameters,
                 which is tight in the entire range. Third, we devise a
                 transformation that decreases the lightness of spanners
                 in general metrics, while keeping all their other
                 parameters in check. Our main result is obtained as a
                 corollary of this transformation.",

                 samples. Most natural algorithms of interest in theory

                 applicable and empirically successful approach for
                 finding low-rank matrices that best fit the given data.
                 For example, for the problem of low-rank matrix
                 completion, this method is believed to be one of the
                 most accurate and efficient, and formed a major
                 component of the winning entry in the Netflix Challenge
                 [17]. In the alternating minimization approach, the
                 low-rank target matrix is written in a bi-linear form,
                 i.e. X = UV$^+$; the algorithm then alternates between
                 finding the best U and the best V. Typically, each
                 alternating step in isolation is convex and tractable.
                 However the overall problem becomes non-convex and is
                 prone to local minima. In fact, there has been almost
                 no theoretical understanding of when this approach
                 yields a good result. In this paper we present one of
                 the first theoretical analyses of the performance of
                 alternating minimization for matrix completion, and the
                 related problem of matrix sensing. For both these
                 problems, celebrated recent results have shown that
                 they become well-posed and tractable once certain (now
                 standard) conditions are imposed on the problem. We
                 show that alternating minimization also succeeds under
                 similar conditions. Moreover, compared to existing
                 results, our paper shows that alternating minimization
                 guarantees faster (in particular, geometric)
                 convergence to the true matrix, while allowing a
                 significantly simpler analysis.",

                 family of NP-hard optimization problems that includes
                 satisfiability. Motivated by the sufficient condition
                 for the satisfiability of SAT formulae that is offered
                 by the Lovasz Local Lemma, we seek such sufficient
                 conditions for arbitrary CSPs. To this end, we identify
                 a variable-covering radius--type parameter for the
                 infeasible configurations of a given CSP, and also
                 develop an extension of the Lovasz Local Lemma in which
                 many of the events to be avoided have probabilities
                 arbitrarily close to one; these lead to a general
                 sufficient condition for the satisfiability of
                 arbitrary CSPs. One primary application is to
                 packet-routing in the classical Leighton-Maggs-Rao

                 on a fixed finite domain; such a set is called a
                 finite-valued constraint language. The valued
                 constraint satisfaction problem, VCSP( $ \Gamma $), is
                 the problem of minimising a function given as a sum of
                 functions from $ \Gamma $ . We establish a dichotomy
                 theorem with respect to exact solvability for all
                 finite-valued languages defined on domains of arbitrary
                 finite size. We show that every core language $ \Gamma
                 $ either admits a binary idempotent and symmetric
                 fractional polymorphism in which case the basic linear
                 programming relaxation solves any instance of VCSP( $

                 hardness condition that allows for a polynomial-time
                 reduction from Max-Cut to VCSP( $ \Gamma $). In other
                 words, there is a single algorithm for all tractable

                 basic linear programming relaxation suffices and

  abstract =     "Random $k$-SAT is the single most intensely studied
                 example of a random constraint satisfaction problem.
                 But despite substantial progress over the past decade,
                 the threshold for the existence of satisfying
                 assignments is not known precisely for any $ k \geq 3
                 $. The best current results, based on the second moment
                 method, yield upper and lower bounds that differ by an
                 additive $ k \cdot {\ln 2} / 2 $, a term that is
                 unbounded in $k$ (Achlioptas, Peres: STOC 2003). The
                 basic reason for this gap is the inherent asymmetry of
                 the Boolean values 'true' and 'false' in contrast to
                 the perfect symmetry, e.g., among the various colors in
                 a graph coloring problem. Here we develop a new
                 asymmetric second moment method that allows us to
                 tackle this issue head on for the first time in the
                 theory of random CSPs. This technique enables us to
                 compute the $k$-SAT threshold up to an additive $ \ln 2
                 - 1 / 2 + O(1 / k) \sim 0.19 $. Independently of the
                 rigorous work, physicists have developed a
                 sophisticated but non-rigorous technique called the
                 ``cavity method'' for the study of random CSPs (Mezard,
                 Parisi, Zecchina: Science~2002). Our result matches the
                 best bound that can be obtained from the so-called
                 ``replica symmetric'' version of the cavity method, and
                 indeed our proof directly harnesses parts of the
                 physics calculations.",

                 all-pairs $ 1 + \epsilon $ approximate shortest paths
                 under deletions and weight-increases. The previous
                 state of the art for this problem was total update time
                 $ \tilde O (n^2 \sqrt m / \epsilon) $ for directed,
                 unweighted graphs [2], and $ \tilde O(m n / \epsilon) $
                 for undirected, unweighted graphs [12]. Both algorithms
                 were randomized and had constant query time. Note that
                 $ \tilde O(m n) $ is a natural barrier because even
                 with a $ (1 + \epsilon) $ approximation, there is no $
                 o(m n) $ combinatorial algorithm for the static
                 all-pairs shortest path problem. Our algorithm works on
                 directed, weighted graphs and has total (randomized)
                 update time $ \tilde O (m n \log (R) / \epsilon) $
                 where $R$ is the ratio of the largest edge weight ever
                 seen in the graph, to the smallest such weight (our
                 query time is constant). Note that $ \log (R) = O(\log
                 (n)) $ as long as weights are polynomial in $n$.
                 Although $ \tilde O(m n \log (R) / \epsilon) $ is the
                 total time over all updates, our algorithm also
                 requires a clearly unavoidable constant time per
                 update. Thus, we effectively expand the $ \tilde O(m n)
                 $ total update time bound from undirected, unweighted
                 graphs to directed graphs with polynomial weights. This
                 is in fact the first non-trivial algorithm for
                 decremental all-pairs shortest paths that works on
                 weighted graphs (previous algorithms could only handle
                 small integer weights). By a well known reduction from
                 decremental algorithms to fully dynamic ones [9], our
                 improved decremental algorithm leads to improved
                 query-update tradeoffs for fully dynamic $ (1 +

                 deterministic algorithm that outperforms the naive $
                 O(n) $ one was reported up to this date. The only
                 progress in this direction is due to Ivkovic and Lloyd
                 [14], who in 1993 devised a deterministic algorithm
                 with an amortized update time of O((n+m)$^{ \sqrt 2 /

                 show the first deterministic fully dynamic algorithm
                 that outperforms the trivial one. Specifically, we
                 provide a deterministic worst-case update time of $
                 O(\sqrt m) $. Moreover, our algorithm maintains a
                 matching which is in fact a 3/2-approximate maximum
                 cardinality matching (MCM). We remark that no fully
                 dynamic algorithm for maintaining $ (2 - \epsilon)
                 $-approximate MCM improving upon the naive $ O(n) $ was
                 known prior to this work, even allowing amortized time
                 bounds and randomization. For low arboricity graphs
                 (e.g., planar graphs and graphs excluding fixed
                 minors), we devise another simple deterministic
                 algorithm with sub-logarithmic update time.
                 Specifically, it maintains a fully dynamic maximal
                 matching with amortized update time of $ O(\log n /
                 \log \log n) $. This result addresses an open question
                 of Onak and Rubinfeld [19]. We also show a
                 deterministic algorithm with optimal space usage of $
                 O(n + m) $, that for arbitrary graphs maintains a
                 maximal matching with amortized update time of $

                 flow computations which are carried out in linear time
                 using fast Laplacian solvers. However, in contrast to
                 previous work, our algorithm does not reweight the
                 edges of the graph in any way, and instead uses local
                 (i.e., non s-t) electrical flows to reroute the flow on
                 congested edges. The algorithm is simple and may be
                 viewed as trying to find a point at the intersection of
                 two convex sets (the affine subspace of st-flows of

                 the previous best running time of $ \tilde O(m + \min
                 (n F, m^{3 / 2})) $. We give a related algorithm with

                 discrete distribution: Given n non-negative w-bit
                 integers x$_1$ ,..,x$_n$, the task is to build a data
                 structure that allows sampling i with probability
                 proportional to x$_i$. The classic solution is Walker's
                 alias method that takes, when implemented on a Word
                 RAM, $ O(n) $ preprocessing time, $ O(1) $ expected
                 query time for one sample, and $ n(w + 2 \lg (n) +
                 o(1)) $ bits of space. Using the terminology of
                 succinct data structures, this solution has redundancy
                 $ 2 n \lg (n) + o(n) $ bits, i.e., it uses $ 2 n \lg
                 (n) + o(n) $ bits in addition to the information
                 theoretic minimum required for storing the input. In
                 this paper, we study whether this space usage can be
                 improved. In the systematic case, in which the input is
                 read-only, we present a novel data structure using $ r
                 + O(w) $ redundant bits, $ O(n / r) $ expected query
                 time and $ O(n) $ preprocessing time for any $r$. This
                 is an improvement in redundancy by a factor of $ \Omega
                 (\log n) $ over the alias method for $ r = n $, even
                 though the alias method is not systematic. Moreover, we
                 complement our data structure with a lower bound
                 showing that this trade-off is tight for systematic
                 data structures. In the non-systematic case, in which
                 the input numbers may be represented in more clever
                 ways than just storing them one-by-one, we demonstrate
                 a very surprising separation from the systematic case:
                 With only 1 redundant bit, it is possible to support
                 optimal $ O(1) $ expected query time and $ O(n) $
                 preprocessing time! On the one hand, our results
                 improve upon the space requirement of the classic
                 solution for a fundamental sampling problem, on the
                 other hand, they provide the strongest known separation
                 between the systematic and non-systematic case for any
                 data structure problem. Finally, we also believe our
                 upper bounds are practically efficient and simpler than

                 previously the best known extractor needs to use at

                 In this paper we give a new extractor that only uses $

                 Thus, our result improves the previous best result

                 delegated to an untrusted server. Following the
                 literature on property testing, we seek proof systems
                 where with high probability the verifier accepts every
                 input in the language, and rejects every input that is
                 far from the language. The verifier's query complexity
                 (and computation complexity), as well as the
                 communication, should all be sublinear. We call such a
                 proof system an Interactive Proof of Proximity (IPP).
                 On the positive side, our main result is that all
                 languages in NC have Interactive Proofs of Proximity
                 with roughly $ \sqrt n $ query and communication and
                 complexities, and $ \polylog (n) $ communication
                 rounds. This is achieved by identifying a natural

                 structured class of subspaces), that is complete for
                 constructing interactive proofs of proximity, and
                 providing efficient protocols for it. In building an
                 IPP for this complete language, we show a tradeoff
                 between the query and communication complexity and the
                 number of rounds. For example, we give a 2-round
                 protocol with roughly $ n^{3 / 4} $ queries and
                 communication. On the negative side, we show that there
                 exist natural languages in N$ C^1 $, for which the sum
                 of queries and communication in any constant-round
                 interactive proof of proximity must be polynomially
                 related to $n$. In particular, for any 2-round
                 protocol, the sum of queries and communication must be
                 at least $ \tilde \Omega (\sqrt n) $. Finally, we
                 construct much better IPPs for specific functions, such
                 as bipartiteness on random or well-mixing graphs, and
                 the majority function. The query complexities of these
                 protocols are provably better (by exponential or
                 polynomial factors) than what is possible in the

                 natural number in the set $ \{ 0, 1, \ldots {}, 2^n - 1
                 \} $ in binary form. The operations included in the
                 structure are the four constants $ 0, 1, 2^n - 1, n $,
                 multiplication and addition modulo $ 2^n $, the unary
                 function $ \{ \min 2^x, 2^n - 1 \} $, the binary
                 functions $ \lfloor x / y \rfloor $ (with $ \lfloor x /

                 performing the operations on all components

                 operations that can be performed on a RAM, with
                 wordlength $n$, by a single instruction. We show that
                 there exists an $ \epsilon > 0 $ and a term (that is,
                 an algebraic expression) $ F(x, y) $ built up from the
                 mentioned operations, with the only free variables $x$,
                 $y$, such that if $ G_d(y), d = 0, 1, 2, \ldots {} $,
                 is a sequence of terms, and for all $ d = 0, 1, 2,
                 \ldots {}, M_d $ models $ \forall x, [G_d (x) \to
                 \exists y, F(x, y) = 0] $, then for infinitely many
                 integers $d$, the depth of the term $ G_d $, that is,
                 the maximal number of nestings of the operations in it,
                 is at least $ \epsilon (\log d)^{1 / 2} = \epsilon
                 (\log \log n)^{1 / 2} $. The following is a
                 consequence. We are considering RAMs $ N_n $, with
                 wordlength $ n = 2^d $, whose arithmetic instructions
                 are the arithmetic operations listed above, and also
                 have the usual other RAM instructions. The size of the
                 memory is restricted only by the address space, that
                 is, it is $ 2^n $ words. The RAMs has a finite
                 instruction set, each instruction is encoded by a fixed
                 natural number independently of $n$. Therefore a
                 program $P$ can run on each machine $ N_n $, if $ n =
                 2^d $ is sufficiently large. We show that there exists
                 an $ \epsilon > 0 $ and a program $P$, such that it
                 satisfies the following two conditions. (i) For all
                 sufficiently large $ n = 2^d $, if $P$ running on N$_n$
                 gets an input consisting of two words $a$ and $b$,
                 then, in constant time, it gives a $ 0, 1 $ output $
                 P_n(a, b) $. (ii) Suppose that $Q$ is a program such
                 that for each sufficiently large $ n = 2^d $, if $Q$,
                 running on $ N_n $, gets a word $a$ of length $n$ as an
                 input, then it decides whether there exists a word $b$
                 of length $n$ such that $ P_n(a, b) = 0. $ Then, for
                 infinitely many positive integers $d$, there exists a
                 word $a$ of length $ n = 2^d $, such that the running
                 time of $Q$ on $ N_n $ at input $a$ is at least $

                 codes with exponential block length. However, for
                 composite $m$ the behaviour is dramatically different.
                 A recent work by Efremenko [8] (based on an approach
                 initiated by Yekhanin [24]) gives the first
                 sub-exponential LDC with constant queries. It is based
                 on a construction of a MV family of super-polynomial
                 size by Grolmusz [10] modulo composite $m$. In this
                 work, we prove two lower bounds on the block length of
                 LDCs which are based on black box construction using MV
                 families. When $q$ is constant (or sufficiently small),
                 we prove that such LDCs must have a quadratic block
                 length. When the modulus $m$ is constant (as it is in
                 the construction of Efremenko [8]) we prove a
                 super-polynomial lower bound on the block-length of the
                 LDCs, assuming a well-known conjecture in additive
                 combinatorics, the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture
                 over Z$_m$.",

  abstract =     "We describe new constructions of error correcting
                 codes, obtained by ``degree-lifting'' a short algebraic
                 geometry base-code of block-length $q$ to a lifted-code
                 of block-length $ q^m $, for arbitrary integer $m$. The
                 construction generalizes the way degree-d, univariate
                 polynomials evaluated over the $q$-element field (also
                 known as Reed--Solomon codes) are ``lifted'' to
                 degree-d, $m$-variate polynomials (Reed--Muller codes).
                 A number of properties are established: The rate of the
                 degree-lifted code is approximately a 1/m!-fraction of
                 the rate of the base-code. The relative distance of the
                 degree-lifted code is at least as large as that of the
                 base-code. This is proved using a generalization of the
                 Schwartz-Zippel Lemma to degree-lifted
                 Algebraic-Geometry codes. [Local correction] If the
                 base code is invariant under a group that is ``close''
                 to being doubly-transitive (in a precise manner defined
                 later) then the degree-lifted code is locally
                 correctable with query complexity at most $ q^2 $. The
                 automorphisms of the base-code are crucially used to
                 generate query-sets, abstracting the use of
                 affine-lines in the local correction procedure of
                 Reed--Muller codes. Taking a concrete illustrating
                 example, we show that degree-lifted Hermitian codes
                 form a family of locally correctable codes over an
                 alphabet that is significantly smaller than that
                 obtained by Reed--Muller codes of similar constant
                 rate, message length, and distance.",

                 correct a fraction of errors approaching the code

                 a well-structured affine space of dimension a constant
                 factor smaller than the code dimension. By pre-coding
                 the message polynomials into a subspace-evasive set, we
                 get a Monte Carlo construction of a subcode of
                 Reed--Solomon codes that can be list decoded from a
                 fraction $ (1 - R - \epsilon) $ of errors in polynomial
                 time (for any fixed $ \epsilon > 0 $) with a list size
                 of $ O(1 / \epsilon) $. Our methods extend to
                 algebraic-geometric (AG) codes, leading to a similar
                 claim over constant-sized alphabets. This matches
                 parameters of recent results based on folded variants
                 of RS and AG codes. but our construction here gives
                 subcodes of Reed--Solomon and AG codes themselves
                 (albeit with restrictions on the evaluation points).
                 Further, the underlying algebraic idea also extends
                 nicely to Gabidulin's construction of rank-metric codes
                 based on linearized polynomials. This gives the first
                 construction of positive rate rank-metric codes list
                 decodable beyond half the distance, and in fact gives
                 codes of rate $R$ list decodable up to the optimal $ (1
                 - R - \epsilon) $ fraction of rank errors. A similar
                 claim holds for the closely related subspace codes
                 studied by Koetter and Kschischang. We introduce a new
                 notion called subspace designs as another way to
                 pre-code messages and prune the subspace of candidate
                 solutions. Using these, we also get a deterministic
                 construction of a polynomial time list decodable
                 subcode of RS codes. By using a cascade of several
                 subspace designs, we extend our approach to AG codes,
                 which gives the first deterministic construction of an
                 algebraic code family of rate $R$ with efficient list
                 decoding from $ 1 - R - \epsilon $ fraction of errors
                 over an alphabet of constant size (that depends only on
                 $ \epsilon $). The list size bound is almost a
                 constant (governed by $ \log * $ (block length)), and
                 the code can be constructed in quasi-polynomial time.",

                 However, until recently, a similar statement about
                 random linear codes has until remained elusive. In a

                 is relatively simple. Finally, we extend our methods to
                 more general ensembles of linear codes. As an example,
                 we show that randomly punctured Reed--Muller codes have

                 study of correlations in quantum multipartite states.
                 In this paper we prove two new quantum de Finetti
                 theorems, both showing that under tests formed by local
                 measurements in each of the subsystems one can get a
                 much improved error dependence on the dimension of the
                 subsystems. We also obtain similar results for
                 non-signaling probability distributions. We give the
                 following applications of the results to quantum
                 complexity theory, polynomial optimization, and quantum
                 information theory: We prove the optimality of the
                 Chen-Drucker protocol for 3-SAT, under the assumption
                 there is no subexponential-time algorithm for SAT. In
                 the protocol a prover sends to a verifier $ \sqrt n
                 \polylog (n) $ unentangled quantum states, each
                 composed of $ O(\log (n)) $ qubits, as a proof of the
                 satisfiability of a 3-SAT instance with $n$ variables
                 and $ O(n) $ clauses. The quantum verifier checks the
                 validity of the proof by performing local measurements
                 on each of the proofs and classically processing the
                 outcomes. We show that any similar protocol with $
                 O(n^{1 / 2 - \epsilon }) $ qubits would imply a $ \exp
                 (n^{1 - 2 \epsilon } \polylog (n)) $-time algorithm for
                 3-SAT. We show that the maximum winning probability of
                 free games (in which the questions to each prover are
                 chosen independently) can be estimated by linear
                 programming in time $ \exp (O(\log |Q| + \log^2 |A| /
                 \epsilon^2)) $, with $ |Q| $ and $ |A| $ the question
                 and answer alphabet sizes, respectively, matching the
                 performance of a previously known algorithm due to
                 Aaronson, Impagliazzo, Moshkovitz, and Shor. This
                 result follows from a new monogamy relation for
                 non-locality, showing that $k$-extendible non-signaling
                 distributions give at most a $ O(k^{-1 / 2}) $
                 advantage over classical strategies for free games. We
                 also show that 3-SAT with $n$ variables can be reduced
                 to obtaining a constant error approximation of the
                 maximum winning probability under entangled strategies
                 of $ O(\sqrt n) $-player one-round non-local games, in
                 which only two players are selected to send $ O(\sqrt
                 n) $-bit messages. We show that the optimization of
                 certain polynomials over the complex hypersphere can be
                 performed in quasipolynomial time in the number of
                 variables $n$ by considering $ O(\log (n)) $ rounds of
                 the Sum-of-Squares (Parrilo/Lasserre) hierarchy of
                 semidefinite programs. This can be considered an
                 analogue to the hypersphere of a similar known results
                 for the simplex. As an application to entanglement
                 theory, we find a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for
                 deciding multipartite separability. We consider a
                 quantum tomography result due to Aaronson --- showing
                 that given an unknown $n$-qubit state one can perform
                 tomography that works well for most observables by
                 measuring only $ O(n) $ independent and identically
                 distributed (i.i.d.) copies of the state --- and relax
                 the assumption of having i.i.d copies of the state to
                 merely the ability to select subsystems at random from
                 a quantum multipartite state. The proofs of the new
                 quantum de Finetti theorems are based on information
                 theory, in particular on the chain rule of mutual
                 information. The results constitute improvements and
                 generalizations of a recent de Finetti theorem due to

  abstract =     "The local Hamiltonian problem consists of estimating
                 the ground-state energy (given by the minimum
                 eigenvalue) of a local quantum Hamiltonian. It can be
                 considered as a quantum generalization of constraint
                 satisfaction problems (CSPs) and has a key role in
                 quantum complexity theory, being the first and most
                 natural QMA -complete problem known. An interesting
                 regime for the local Hamiltonian problem is that of
                 extensive error, where one is interested in estimating
                 the mean ground-state energy to constant accuracy. The
                 problem is NP -hard by the PCP theorem, but whether it
                 is QMA -hard is an important open question in quantum
                 complexity theory. A positive solution would represent
                 a quantum analogue of the PCP theorem. A key feature
                 that distinguishes quantum Hamiltonians from classical
                 CSPs is that the solutions may involve complicated
                 entangled states. In this paper, we demonstrate several
                 large classes of Hamiltonians for which product (i.e.
                 unentangled) states can approximate the ground state
                 energy to within a small extensive error. First, we
                 show the mere existence of a good product-state
                 approximation for the ground-state energy of 2-local
                 Hamiltonians with one of more of the following
                 properties: (1) super-constant degree, (2) small
                 expansion, or (3) a ground state with sublinear
                 entanglement with respect to some partition into small
                 pieces. The approximation based on degree is a new and
                 surprising difference between quantum Hamiltonians and
                 classical CSPs, since in the classical setting, higher
                 degree is usually associated with harder CSPs. The
                 approximation based on expansion is not new, but the
                 approximation based on low entanglement was previously
                 known only in the regime where the entanglement was
                 close to zero. Since the existence of a low-energy
                 product state can be checked in NP, this implies that
                 any Hamiltonian used for a quantum PCP theorem should
                 have: (1) constant degree, (2) constant expansion, (3)
                 a ``volume law'' for entanglement with respect to any
                 partition into small parts. Second, we show that in
                 several cases, good product-state approximations not
                 only exist, but can be found in deterministic
                 polynomial time: (1) 2-local Hamiltonians on any planar
                 graph, solving an open problem of Bansal, Bravyi, and
                 Terhal, (2) dense k -local Hamiltonians for any
                 constant k, solving an open problem of Gharibian and
                 Kempe, and (3) 2-local Hamiltonians on graphs with low
                 threshold rank, via a quantum generalization of a
                 recent result of Barak, Raghavendra and Steurer. Our
                 work involves two new tools which may be of independent
                 interest. First, we prove a new quantum version of the
                 de Finetti theorem which does not require the usual
                 assumption of symmetry. Second, we describe a way to

                 known classical algorithms for matrix inversion (and
                 singular value decomposition) as far as space is
                 concerned. This adds to the (still short) list of
                 important problems where quantum computers are of help.
                 Specifically, we show that the inverse of a well
                 conditioned matrix can be approximated in quantum
                 logspace with intermediate measurements. This should be
                 compared with the best known classical algorithm for
                 the problem that requires $ \Omega (\log^2 n) $ space.
                 We also show how to approximate the spectrum of a
                 normal matrix, or the singular values of an arbitrary
                 matrix, with $ \epsilon $ additive accuracy, and how to
                 approximate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a
                 matrix whose singular values are well separated. The
                 technique builds on ideas from several previous works,
                 including simulating Hamiltonians in small quantum

                 exact quantum algorithms over their classical
                 counterparts: deterministic algorithms. For total
                 Boolean functions in the query model, the biggest known
                 gap was just a factor of $2$: PARITY of $N$ input bits
                 requires $N$ queries classically but can be computed
                 with $ N / 2 $ queries by an exact quantum algorithm.
                 We present the first example of a Boolean function $

  abstract =     "Fingerprinting is a widely-used technique for
                 efficiently verifying that two files are identical.
                 More generally, linear sketching is a form of lossy
                 compression (based on random projections) that also
                 enables the ``dissimilarity'' of non-identical files to
                 be estimated. Many sketches have been proposed for
                 dissimilarity measures that decompose coordinate-wise
                 such as the Hamming distance between alphanumeric
                 strings, or the Euclidean distance between vectors.
                 However, virtually nothing is known on sketches that
                 would accommodate alignment errors. With such errors,
                 Hamming or Euclidean distances are rendered useless: a
                 small misalignment may result in a file that looks very
                 dissimilar to the original file according such
                 measures. In this paper, we present the first linear
                 sketch that is robust to a small number of alignment
                 errors. Specifically, the sketch can be used to
                 determine whether two files are within a small Hamming
                 distance of being a cyclic shift of each other.
                 Furthermore, the sketch is homomorphic with respect to
                 rotations: it is possible to construct the sketch of a
                 cyclic shift of a file given only the sketch of the
                 original file. The relevant dissimilarity measure,
                 known as the shift distance, arises in the context of
                 embedding edit distance and our result addressed an
                 open problem [Question 13 in
                 Indyk-McGregor-Newman-Onak'11] with a rather surprising
                 outcome. Our sketch projects a length $n$ file into $
                 D(n) \cdot \polylog n $ dimensions where $ D(n)l n $ is
                 the number of divisors of $n$. The striking fact is
                 that this is near-optimal, i.e., the $ D(n) $
                 dependence is inherent to a problem that is ostensibly
                 about lossy compression. In contrast, we then show that
                 any sketch for estimating the edit distance between two
                 files, even when small, requires sketches whose size is
                 nearly linear in $n$. This lower bound addresses a
                 long-standing open problem on the low distortion
                 embeddings of edit distance [Question 2.15 in
                 Naor-Matousek'11, Indyk'01], for the case of linear

                 it is stored in one of the unoccupied bins. If all the

  abstract =     "We study several stochastic combinatorial problems,
                 including the expected utility maximization problem,
                 the stochastic knapsack problem and the stochastic bin
                 packing problem. A common technical challenge in these
                 problems is to optimize some function (other than the
                 expectation) of the sum of a set of random variables.
                 The difficulty is mainly due to the fact that the
                 probability distribution of the sum is the convolution
                 of a set of distributions, which is not an easy
                 objective function to work with. To tackle this
                 difficulty, we introduce the Poisson approximation
                 technique. The technique is based on the Poisson
                 approximation theorem discovered by Le Cam, which
                 enables us to approximate the distribution of the sum
                 of a set of random variables using a compound Poisson
                 distribution. Using the technique, we can reduce a
                 variety of stochastic problems to the corresponding
                 deterministic multiple-objective problems, which either
                 can be solved by standard dynamic programming or have
                 known solutions in the literature. For the problems
                 mentioned above, we obtain the following results: We
                 first study the expected utility maximization problem
                 introduced recently [Li and Despande, FOCS11]. For
                 monotone and Lipschitz utility functions, we obtain an
                 additive PTAS if there is a multidimensional PTAS for
                 the multi-objective version of the problem, strictly
                 generalizing the previous result. The result implies
                 the first additive PTAS for maximizing threshold
                 probability for the stochastic versions of global
                 min-cut, matroid base and matroid intersection. For the
                 stochastic bin packing problem (introduced in
                 [Kleinberg, Rabani and Tardos, STOC97]), we show there
                 is a polynomial time algorithm which uses at most the
                 optimal number of bins, if we relax the size of each
                 bin and the overflow probability by e for any constant
                 $ \epsilon > 0 $. Based on this result, we obtain a
                 3-approximation if only the size of each bin can be
                 relaxed by $ \epsilon $ , improving the known $ O(1 /
                 \epsilon) $ factor for constant overflow probability.
                 For stochastic knapsack, we show a $ (1 + \epsilon)
                 $-approximation using $ \epsilon $ extra capacity for
                 any $ \epsilon > 0 $, even when the size and reward of
                 each item may be correlated and cancelations of items
                 are allowed. This generalizes the previous work
                 [Balghat, Goel and Khanna, SODA11] for the case without
                 correlation and cancelation. Our algorithm is also
                 simpler. We also present a factor $ 2 + \epsilon $
                 approximation algorithm for stochastic knapsack with
                 cancelations, for any constant $ \epsilon > 0 $,
                 improving the current known approximation factor of 8
                 [Gupta, Krishnaswamy, Molinaro and Ravi, FOCS11]. We
                 also study an interesting variant of the stochastic
                 knapsack problem, where the size and the profit of each
                 item are revealed before the decision is made. The
                 problem falls into the framework of Bayesian online
                 selection problems, which has been studied a lot
                 recently.",
